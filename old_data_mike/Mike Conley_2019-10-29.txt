The mailman showing some love for @spidadmitchell and @MCONLEY10 
Breakout game! You heard it here first! Haha
That would be great! I thought at first these were his stats for the whole season so far (not too far off as he has 31/17/9 with 3 threes in 4 games). He is going to be good when he figures things out. :)
21 points/7 assists/4 rebounds with 3 threes. @MCONLEY10 ‘s stat line tomorrow. #MarkItDown #TakeNote
加油！康利！
@MCONLEY10 do better. 
GrizzFans...did Grasshopper just snatch the pebble from Master @MCONLEY10’s hand...? Nice to see @nextlevel_03 excel! #gng
Game 4 "Psalm" by John Coltrane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmbWRZfOgwc Record: 3-1; Streak: 2 wins
@MCONLEY10 keep that head up bro, take over like you did in Memphis. Command the team, be a leader. Jazz nation believes you’re the guy to take us over the top! Keep grinding!! #TakeNote #LetsGo let the haters hate, I know a #Buckeye never quits!!
Mad respect braddah, all these lames doubting you pay them no mind :)
You understand he was in a whole different system his whole entire career? You understand maybe he isnt comfortable yet? Keep that same energy when he starts getting comfortable lol you a garbage can playboy
@MCONLEY10 stay with it bud, we know you’ll figure it out!
Gtfo with that lame st*t bro... Go join the Knicks fan base you hater.
tampoco hay mucho más en ese draft... Noah, Horford y ya.
no será el Conley actual, desgraciadamente
Hang in there @MCONLEY10 Jazz nation ain’t worried. We got your back! 
I mean this is crazy how many offensive fouls and traveling calls are being made. It’s been so long since they called traveling. I mean @MCONLEY10 couldn’t sneeze without them calling a foul.#gojazz
To if you guys can win when your having a tough time...I can't wait until you get hot!! Tough 5 game stretch..I'm so happy you are in utah thank you
@MCONLEY10 so glad you’re with our team! Excited to see what you can do and to continue cheering for you! Go Jazz :)
Money!
4 matchs attends un peu
Boler!
@MCONLEY10 its been a rough start of the season... but my fantasy team is counting of you man... hope you bounce back soon #noseabacalao
Tu rages que je te sois passé devant ?

Prioritize and execute. You got this.
@Ronan_Pichon je te donne le filon pour ta TTFL
@BuckleUpBoler, I knew you was a baller back when I saw that ridiculous athleticism on the course at TalonsCove for the SLCC Tourney years back. Confirmed. 
The LEGEND, @BuckleUpBoler - you killed it masked man. Thank you 
BOGEY and ONE-TAKE MIKE! Hollywood ready. @MCONLEY10 @44Bojan Thanks for the exclusive @slcdunk 
 EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK @mconley10 gets to know @44bojan better in @vivinthome’s hilarious new commercial. As @BuckleUpBoler would say, “Buckle Up.”
Your a baller. Everyone just needs to calm down. Smh. You will shut them all up as the season goes on.
@MCONLEY10 You've got this, Mike!! We love you! #justkeepswimming #TakeNote
Still waiting for @MCONLEY10 to show up! C'mon man! It's time!! #utahjazz #takenote #nba
@MCONLEY10 
Bro you went 0/7 what were you focused on
@MCONLEY10 7'8pt/2'3reb/4'3a/20%FG/15%T3 @rickyrubio9 10pt/8reb/9'3a/32%FG Jazz (3-1) Suns (2-2) pero las sensaciones de momento de Phoenix, mejores. Han competido todos partidos (1 sin Ricky + sin Ayton) y con Conley errático, aunque aparecerá. Molan estos Suns 
Live footage of Mike Conley
Le preguntaron a Kevin Durant que a qué dos jugadores de su draft elegiría para echar un 3x3 Respuesta: @MarcGasol y @MCONLEY10 . El tipo sabe de esto.
@MCONLEY10 hang tough bro, we got your back......but if you shave your beard or cut your hair, it might change the conversation.... kidding.....
@MCONLEY10 it's all good Mike. We're behind you and you got this. . . Nice win guys let's get after the Clippers now. #takenote
@MCONLEY10 Hey how about you start producing for my fantasy team bud, what you say?
Incroyable @MCONLEY10 oh mon gars c’est ton cousin que le Jazz a pris ou quoi ? Voir un tel joueur autant à côté de ses pompes c’est fou #Utah #NBAextra
game day focus dice, le meto una hostia
He is slow and short. Rubio outplayed him. 0-7 and 1 point. Almost cost us the game. Donovan saved us. $32.5M next year $34.5M. Please retire now.
He’s doing a real great job so far lmfaooo
@MCONLEY10 you are trash man! No points, no assists, turnovers, fouls.... you suck just retire!!!
@MCONLEY10 bruh wtf Lol you balling like a d leaguer 
Utah loves you Mike keep doing ya thing!!!!
It’ll happen Mike! Keep shooting that damn ball! They’ll def start falling soon, then the league better watch TF out! #gojazz #TakeNote
@MCONLEY10 your not getting paid millions of dollars to play like a used diaper, wtf r u doin out they’re 
@MCONLEY10 My guy. Don't sweat it - everyone knows you're gonna flip that switch and get back to it. We got you.
That ally-oop from @MCONLEY10 to @rudygobert27 tonight was fire!!#TakeNote
He’s one of my favorite points in the league and I’m not trash talking my guy I just hope he reads this and it sets a fire so he gets to splashing again.
Exactly.
We did win by 1 bahahaha
@MCONLEY10 bro. You gotta pick it up man. I picked you high in the draft, you’re killing me man. I have faith, but I can’t keep you on my fantasy team if you keep giving me negative points. Let’s go man, I believe in you
Hey @MCONLEY10 maybe it’s time to put the headband back on
@MCONLEY10 you got this Mike!!
Keep your head up @MCONLEY10... Jazz Nation is completely behind you! #TakeNote
@MCONLEY10 Keep shootin. Jazz nation believes in you. We couldn’t have won without your defense and 1 pt game.
I need a Bogdanovic jersey NOW! Dude is straight #TakeNote #TripleBogi Also for the fellow fans @MCONLEY10 will be fine. He probably won't read this but you got this Mike! We believe in you. Keep shooting your shot!
@MCONLEY10 keep your head up! It’ll come!
#utahjazz outshine the Suns in Phoenix. @spidadmitchell Nice finish!!!! @BucketsONeale00 @MCONLEY10 @Joeingles7 @rudygobert27 You guys all played well. Way to bring home the win. @kristenkenney let’s bring them home. And you gotta love it baby! #jazznation #takenote #utahjazz
@MCONLEY10 YOURE SO FUCKING GARBAGE BRO HOLY FUCK!!! RETIRE ALREADY YOU UGLY PRICK
We believe in you @MCONLEY10! Jazz nation is behind you! Can’t wait until you get rolling!
can’t wait for you to find that spark and drop 60 points against the clippers on wednesday @MCONLEY10
Don’t care what anyone says, I’m still grateful @MCONLEY10 is on the @utahjazz #takenote
@MCONLEY10 bring back the headband it will help!
That @MCONLEY10 oop to @rudygobert27 should happen at least 5 times every game..
@MCONLEY10 hold your head up Con! Lots of doubters and haters will be coming out tonight, just know a great ton of us still believe you're going to get it going!
Get in the gym and shoot 1,000 shots a day until you’re back on track. Worry less about your outfits and more about your game. You’re starting the season looking like a dumpster fire but you got this. It’s time to bounce back.
@MCONLEY10 if you could learn how to play basketball that would be fantastic
@MCONLEY10 can’t hit a shot to save his life tonight. Dude has more turnovers than points
@MCONLEY10 keep shooting!!
Conley needs to rock the headband next game! He’s too clutch when it’s on @MCONLEY10 #TakeNote
Some focus 0-6 FG 0-2 3pts 2 rebounds 1 point and 5 fouls #TakeNote 7:52 left in the 4th . I know Utah isn’t fun like Memphis, at least you can pretend to like it out the there. #YourWayBetterThanThisMike
 
Trade idea Conley for Rubio #jazz @utahjazz @rickyrubio9 @MCONLEY10
@MCONLEY10 you hurting my fantasy team so badly this year. And to think I traded @shaiglalex for you... Smh
@MCONLEY10 plz make a shot
New system
Good notation of this, let’s see how things look after 15 games ...this guys been good in the league for a long time
It'd be cool if @MCONLEY10 was allowed to play in this game.
@MCONLEY10 what’s good w you bro?
Can @MCONLEY10 be any worse? 
@MCONLEY10 im actually gunna fold you if u don’t fix up , UR MIKE CONLEY not raymond felton b
All good. Just never seen anyone so passionate about undershirts 
They should do whatever they want they’ve worked hard their whole lives to get to that point I think they deserve to choose if they want sleeves or not
@MCONLEY10 you suck
@MCONLEY10 Mike Conley plays as bad as he looks and that’s saying a lot! @utahjazz Absolute trash!
ELITE
Let’s go boys let’s shine tonight in Phoenix! @spidadmitchell @BucketsONeale00 @Joeingles7 @MCONLEY10 @rudygobert27 @BuckleUpBoler #UtahJazz #takenote #weareutahjazz @BCHoldaway Let’s bring home the win!!! And you gotta love it baby!!!!
Great talk though. Thanks for taking interest in my comments.
No. They shouldn't wear undershirts like the first 50 years of the NBA.
