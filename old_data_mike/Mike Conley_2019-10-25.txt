Everyone pause....Becky and Christen play in the same state as mike now...can y’all please hang out @beckysauerbrunn @MCONLEY10 @ChristenPress
Awesome bro! Pulling for you!
He was also the 5th overall pick so it's according to the Jazz front office he was supposed to be great.
I don't think saying he hasn't stayed healthy long enough to be great is slander. It's a fact. Facts can be negative and still aren't slander. And it's supposed*
All about getting W’s!!!!!
We love you man! Do work!
Welcome to the most loyal fan base in the association
Welcome to Miller Jazz Land @MCONLEY10 
Your the freakin man @MCONLEY10 ! We have your back no matter what now let's go take down the @Lakers #throughThickandThin
@MCONLEY10 welcome to @utahjazz we love you here!!!!
Congratulations @MCONLEY10 
expect a bounce back game for @MCONLEY10 tonight, my prediction is 18-7-4 from him and a big @utahjazz W
.@rudygobert27, @spidadmitchell and Asst. Coach Alex Jensen explain the difference @MCONLEY10 and @44Bojan can make to their 2019-20 Season. Catch them tomorrow as they face the @Lakers 10:30am LIVE on NBA Philippines Facebook and Twitter.
@MCONLEY10 deserves a ring
You are a Jazzman 4 life now!!
I saw it im just teasing lol but that is horrible
Hey! There is a 435 that is representing as well!
@MCONLEY10 how many times did you hear " just keep shootin"? You're the best man. Looking good in Jazz gear! Good luck this year
Welcome to Utah! We love you!
You didn't hesitate once on a single shot. We didn't pay to see you score, we paid to see you play the game right, and you did.
Suppose to be great? According to who? Thats just you putting unrealistic expectations on him and slandering him because of it
So excited to have you in Utah! 
Welcome to Utah! Go have a great season! @MCONLEY10 
I promise we’ll take care of him!
Yeah man. Welcome home, and fire away. Gonna be a helluva season
To have the stones to laugh it off and step up and hit the deal-sealers was awesome. You have never, ever seen anything like the love of a Viv crowd. Just wait til they start going in.. 
Watch the video. Jazz Nation showing #mountainmike nothing but love!!
You’re one of us now. We got you!
Oo shit you a JAZZ now congrats bro I need you to get that ring this year
And many more to come!
We love you! And are sooooooo glad you’re here 
You were 1/16 you sure they weren’t booing?
Once a Jazz fan, always a Jazz fan! Whether in life or the game, we live to play another day. You da man! #fannomatterwhat, #nobandwagonhere
Being there and cheering for Conley at the end was the best!
Right behind the goat, @MCONLEY10, @spidadmitchell has become my 2nd favorite player. Does that make me a jazz fan now? 
Welcome to utah!
