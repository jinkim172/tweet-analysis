Strong. Go maria 
What a trio.....Class, class and more class!
He’s ridiculously hesitant yeah
He did last game, he doesn't shoot enough
Hey we are paying Joe Ingles incredible amounts of money so somebody tell him to get the basketball through the orange circle please thank you all love
If a regular season is equated to a marathon, then that would mean one game is equal to roughly a little more than a quarter of a mile (.32 miles).
With patience and leadership like yours, the empire will come!!
If you think @utahjazz should trade @MCONLEY10, by that logic you should also believe that the @Suns are going to win the title. The season is long. Give it time. Neither of those things are going to happen. #TakeNote
@MCONLEY10 will be just fine. Figuring out a new complex system and all new teammates takes time. As the season wears on, he’ll get back on track. Let’s go #MountainMike!
@MCONLEY10 tomorrow is your night to shine. 
We'd like to see how we can assist you, Brandon. Please DM us.
@chrisdelia
Worst company I've ever delt with, dont waste your time .
That's what they say @spidadmitchell. 
You’ll get there #L1C4 always and forever
I love you. @MCONLEY10
I agree. Great sales staff, horrible product, & ineffective customer support. I set an appointment for a tech to come out & they never showed. On par with everything else.
Ya. Really. Let’s worry about something way more serious. Like Where did the sun go at 5:00 today?

No, not everyone.
You’re good, we’re loving this season so far. Stay healthy, kid.
Hang in there Mr. Mitchell! Your team will come together real soon. And once it does… NBA world watch out! Love your game, by the way!
You a killer!
Utah’s never been this cool so you don’t us nothin
