@eaganspeculator We are sorry to hear that you keep having issues. We want to make sure your issues with the system are resolved. Please DM us for assistance.
Don’t buy this crap. I spend about twenty hours per year fixing my security system. The components go offline and the tech support is basically phone or chat and fix it all yourself. If you enjoy fixing things use Vivint. Otherwise call someone else.

Cody, here to talk more shit for fun, how about the winless Kings beating your Jazz tonite?
@MCONLEY10 Keep going Mike! Back to back games of getting back to form. Tough loss tonight. On to the next one! #takenote Go Jazz!! #mountainmike
Thank you @MCONLEY10
My boy taking some practice shots at the half. @MCONLEY10 @utahjazz #lesolsonit #TakeNote
I don't think most @utahjazz fans realize that @44Bojan has bought the Jazz time. Time for @spidadmitchell to work on what he needs to. Time for @MCONLEY10 to figure things out. Time for our defense to solidify. There is a reason that he is considered the most underrated pickup.
Bruh, play out that contract and get on a real team. I k ow you don’t what to be in Utah
Nice to @MCONLEY10 aggressive early
Starting tonight, again, there is no headband for @MCONLEY10
Let’s go @MCONLEY10 @spidadmitchell
Have you ever seen >99.9% when it is not 100%? @utahjazz off to a nice start even without a great start from @MCONLEY10 and no @daanteee. ESPN must think defense wins championships.
Always good to know the right people
That’s typically where my photos are as well Once in awhile I find nice people who upgrade my photo opportunities 
Wow Tiffanee, courtside photos. Impressed. My Jazz game selfies/photos typically feature severe nosebleeds and high-altitude Vivint vertigo.
