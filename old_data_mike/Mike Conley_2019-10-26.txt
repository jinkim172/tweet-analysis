Keep shooting @MCONLEY10 your stroking it in pregame. It’s only a matter of time!!!!!! 
Thank you @utahjazz for this!! We cheer for our team but please don’t cross that line. We expect performances from our athletes they should expect professional conduct from the fans!!! @spidadmitchell @Joeingles7 @rudygobert27 @MCONLEY10 
It's funny, calm down.
@MCONLEY10 #TakeNote #UtahJazz We are all and this team, take to the Kings tonight

I need to hear this. They looked... well we all saw last night. Very worried about tonight
@MCONLEY10 I know you were off to a rough start opening night, but this is improvement. Let's go Mike, brick by brick, let's turn this ship around. I won't give up on you if you don't give up on me. #fantasybasketball
Throwing some shade at @KembaWalker!!
I feel robbed
I’m so unconcerned about him rn. He could struggle tonight and the next few games and I’d still be unconcerned about it.
I don’t know who needs to hear this, but you’re gonna be just fine. Keep climbing. (I know who needs to hear it it’s @MCONLEY10.)
lol they boutta get jingled
It’s a baaaaaad day to be a King. @threengles @SpidaSZN_ @broncobecka @UtahJazzyman @JinglesWrld @MCONLEY10 @UtahJazz6Man @Jazz3asketball @utahjazz_tipoff @jazzszn @utahjazzbear @JazzNationCP
Mon est #Purple et j'espère voir #Sactown faire un exploit chez vous malgré q vs êtes archi favoris puis avec l'ambiance et la tradition de la forteresse Vivint Smart Home Arena ça promet ! Conley marquer 20 pts devrait passer avec Bojan en moins 
@MCONLEY10 ya can’t keep a good guy down for long. Going to climb that mountain tonight and never look back. Just keep shooting
I'm predicting 15 three pointers make for the @utahjazz tonight!! The lid will come off for @Joeingles7 @MCONLEY10 it's going to be a thing of beauty!
Combien dessus ? 500€? 
C'est chaud
When @MCONLEY10 goes off for 28/6/7 tonight all you haters better shut up. @utahjazz
Sauf blow out c'est donné
Yooo this is too funny! #TakeNote @utahjazz https://youtu.be/kgoHZnmWl_g @spidadmitchell @BucketsONeale00 @Joeingles7 @rudygobert27 @MCONLEY10 @BuckleUpBoler @AlemaHarrington @1280thezone @975Hans @JakeScottZone @ScottyGZone @KembaWalker
1.25 je crois
@MCONLEY10 keep your head up and keep shooting that ball. You’re going to catch and then there’s no stopping #mountainMike!! #TakeNote
Pour Donovan elle est à combien ? 0,99 ? 
Je me demande si il va pas fatiguer un peu ce soir
A little of both my friend. Lol.
Mitchell en ttfl t’en penses quoi ?
Ça va bien arriver un jour tout de façon 
Cette confiance aveugle me plaît.
Son château dans mon coeur
T’es dingue 
La seule personne qui peut empêcher les 20pts de Mike, c'est Mike
c'est donné si fox est effectivement absent ce soir
Tu pourras pas te payer le voyage puisque Conley t’auras ruiné.
En tout cas on lui souhaite 
Mec je sais où t'habites, n'oublie pas
[Sous les conseils avisés de GrizzliesFR]
Elles sont quand même globalement élevées ces côtes scoreur. Conley sera rarement au dessus de 2.
Ça fait du 1/16 (3 pts) puis du 3/11 (13 pts) ça s’améliore un peu donc ce soir 8/12 (22 pts) on y croit 
T’as mis 1€ ou 50€ ? C’est pas pareil ahaha
tu es chaud 
Envers et contre tous. Mon destin dans tes mains. Mon meneur. @MCONLEY10 
@MCONLEY10 's legacy is Alive and well 
Seriously, everyone who's bagging on @MCONLEY10 because of his rough start to the season, chill the hell out! He's gonna be just fine. He's not worried about his shot, and I'm pretty sure Coach Q isn't either, there's no need for us to be at this point. And for those who are
Just relax dude. @MCONLEY10 is going to be just fine. He's had a rough start, and he knows it. He's gonna bounce back, and when he does, you're gonna be glad we have him.
@MCONLEY10 what say you?
You got this @MCONLEY10! Nothing but love for ya.
All I'm saying is that maybe @MCONLEY10 might want to try no headband tonight 
@MCONLEY10 is gonna get buckets tonight...
The Jazz leads 108-83 over the @SacramentoKings in the RS all-time and Utah is a 9.5-point favorite. Can @Mconley10 hit 60 percent of his shots tonight? I say he'll shoot 51 percent or round about. We shall see.
Pulisic é uma boa inspiração pra @MCONLEY10 
@StephenCurry30, @russwest44, @luka7doncic, @Dame_Lillard... @CP3 for legacy purposes, but I personally would put @MCONLEY10
@MCONLEY10 game day meditation. It’s your game tonight. Jazz nation got your back 
If @MCONLEY10 has another bad shooting night tonight, I think the @utahjazz should switch him back to #11. Sorry @daanteee . #takenote
Agreed. I'm not trying to talk too much shit. He is a great player and just needs some time to adjust. Not too much time I hope.
Dear @MCONLEY10, That’s 2 strikes; one more and I’m dropping you from my fantasy squad
Although the current facts hurt, I like the guy and do believe he'll get past this so, not tearing him down. I'm laughing with him. He knows things are comical right now but serious too.
Much thanks to @rudygobert27 @Joeingles7 @spidadmitchell @MCONLEY10 and Bojan for the huge assist on #LeadTogether. #TakeNote
@MCONLEY10 is going to be a beast tonight just watch
@spidadmitchell @rudygobert27 @Joeingles7 @unclejeffgreen @44Bojan @emmanuelmudiay @eddavisXVII @BucketsONeale00 @daanteee @GeorgesNiang20 @MCONLEY10
These are great. @MCONLEY10 hope you are practicing and not watching utah fans tear you apart. 
Man good thing we spent so much on him. At this point I'd kill to get Rubio back. @MCONLEY10 get it together dude you get paid for this. 
@MCONLEY10 Clear your mind! Jazz fans know who you are. We aren’t worried. You have destroyed us for years. You’ll get there. We all have slumps at some point. DONT let it get in your head. JUST keep shooting and don’t hesitate!
@MCONLEY10 Tonight's your coming out party for the Jazz! You got this. #TakeNote
I think we need some help from Bill Murray, @MCONLEY10. We gotta get your powers back https://twitter.com/tribjazz/status/1187978101709344768
On this day in 2016, the Grizzlies beat the Timberwolves 102-98 in the home opener. (@MCONLEY10 - 24 PTS, 4 AST)

.@MCONLEY10 in a clean Air Jordan 34 PE last night. : Kelvin Kuo 

 Le chemin de croix continue pour @MCONLEY10 : 4/27 aux tirs en deux matchs. Son pourcentage de réussite de 14,8% est tout simplement le pire de l'histoire pour un joueur totalisant au moins 25 tentatives sur les deux premières rencontres d'une saison. 
Welcome to Utah!
Jeff green the first person I’ve seen sauce up the low top Travis Scott’s
@MCONLEY10 you will be fine Mike.
Bernard King had a major impression on me as a teenager Suited/briefcase/overcoat (Polished ) Kobe was the last of that era ... these costumes on display for kids now are hideous
We're not worried @MCONLEY10. Just keep working, keep doing what you do, and most of all keep shooting. Everything will be fine.
@MCONLEY10 I don’t think your three-point shooting ability is poor. You can make it, you just need more passion, more desire to get the scores. I’ve been watching you playing since 2011. Do you remember your nickname in Memphis? So trust yourself and ignore other people’s voices.
@MCONLEY10 probably 
Hi Mike, I always believe your abilities. You just need one opportunity to show. Please try to communicate more with your teammates for more details, like which spots they prefer, which way you like most. For most of the time, the problem is about miscommunication. Good luck!
Hey @MCONLEY10 keep doing your thing on the court... You've got this! God is good! #takenote
@MCONLEY10 Please stop playing like complete shite. Thanks.
@MCONLEY10 you’ll get your flow. Don’t worry, Jazz Nation still loves you.
Damn, AD had y'all shook @MCONLEY10 @spidadmitchell
Did @MCONLEY10 just call @GeorgesNiang20 “Georgie”? That’s cute. #TakeNote
Keep ur head up @MCONLEY10.... You started slow last year too so keep pushing man. Its just a matter of time.
@MCONLEY10 keep shooting with confidence I can’t wait see you get out of this funk and explode I ain’t taking NO Conley slander tonight he’s our guy and he will figure it out!! #TakeNote

@MCONLEY10 has been terrible for the @utahjazz this year
We didn’t play great tonight but we’ll be fine!! @MCONLEY10 saw shots go down tonight and is due for a big slump buster game!!
Still weird to see Mike Conley in a different uniform. @MCONLEY10 is one of the best! Memphis misses you and @MarcGasol
@MCONLEY10 Keep pushing Mike!! You got this man! Pretty soon we will be shouting MVP. We have desperately wanted you on this team for a reason. #TakeNote #UtahJazz
@MCONLEY10 I’m sorry you didn’t have the first two games you wanted on the Jazz. But I’m more than happy you’re here and part of this team. If you see negativity, just know this Jazz fan is a fan always and will cheer you on. Keep plugging away. #TakeNote
Hey @MCONLEY10, we are glad you’re on our team. Just go out and have fun and be yourself. The state is behind you. You don’t have to carry the whole team by yourself. The strength of the team is team! Excited to see you relax and starting scoring. #TakeNote
Alright @MCONLEY10 Just have fun next game. Play loose. No pressure. You got this. 
@MCONLEY10 can you hoop
@MCONLEY10 you sucks
it’s the altitude bruh
@MCONLEY10 hello mike! Zac here and I’ll just appreciate it if you could drop 50 tomorrow.. we need ya
Ta de brincadeira msm, erro tudo loco, custo esses pontos
Even @MCONLEY10 couldn’t believe that dropped.
Please focus on your fg%
