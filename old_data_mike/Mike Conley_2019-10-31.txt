Thank you for saving my team @MCONLEY10
@MCONLEY10 3rd Quarter shot chart last night 
all the way baby.
Didn’t know you were the new Jazz beat writer? Congrats
Nah, he can’t even talk his own hand into that.
Bet, I'll shoot him a DM.
Thanks Web that’s our brother we got it ;) tell him you know me !
Anything you’d like me to pass along to him?
@kanyewest
Watching your highlights from the other night still gives me chills man. Good job @MCONLEY10
Great win guys!! Can’t wait to see how you guys do all season! #JazzNation #UtahJazz #SpidaMitchell #MikeConely @MCONLEY10 @spidadmitchell @JazzNationNews @Joeingles7 @rudygobert27
Dope
Looks like @MCONLEY10 and @spidadmitchell are gonna be great friends and teammates with the @utahjazz! http://bit.ly/321WN75
Told em @MCONLEY10 was gone get right 
One of my all-time favorite moments as a Jazz fan was to see you go off and the Viv recognize. We only hope you love it here as much as we love having you. Serve all these s this year, you boys are cookin' up something special.. #MountainMike
WTH dude, wanna talk or something? That came out of leftfield
I’m sending you the dry cleaning bill!!!!!
Welcome to the Jazz Mr Mike
Nice set here run by Quinn Snyder for @MCONLEY10 who was cooking late in the 3rd for the @utahjazz. #NBA @FastModel
Great job yesterday! You killed it!
If all Utahns were as Christlike as @Spidadmitchell and @Mconley10, the Beehive State would be an even better place. How lucky is Utah: the best athletes (whom kids already look up to naturally) are also the best role models in the community!
It’s just very early in the season. He’s saying that he’s never heard a crowd respond the way they did that early in the season before. My opinion is that he’s saying it’s more of a late season/playoff feel to it.
Look at Dave Pasch, see’s it coming and plays it with a straight face.
See? @MCONLEY10 ! Like I said : take off this headband = sucess! 
Agree he is a good player mate, but not a superstar for the huge max contract he signed for....got paid way overs!
Man watching the game had me in my emotions man! Great game!
-Jesus is king
Im sorry I like the Jazz im just salty 
Yeah beating my Clippers without Kawhi and PG , really impressive.
Other NBA players looking at the Jazz teammates

ELITE
He is comfy now! The rest of the nba just took note that the jazz are here!!
Great game yesterday! #MountainMike
I don’t want to sound dramatic but I would literally die for Mountain Mike
I know he’s in good hands. Go win a ring.
We’ll take good care of him here in the 801
No Kawhi or pg.
You the man Mountain MIKE!!!

Mountain time. “Did everything but gave up” Selah
@Money23Green You Elbowed @MCONLEY10 In His Eyesocket In The Playoffs. You Kicked Steven Adams In Nuts. You Kicked @KingJames In The Nuts. You Tripped Him In The Finals. You Pushed @JHarden13 To The Floor After He Postered You. Bush League Player. Look How Life Return Energy 
I can't stop thinking about #MountainMike - so, how about a BONUS WALLPAPER for your iPhone 11? @MCONLEY10 #trickortreat #TakeNote #iPhone11 #utahjazz
Game 5 "Chameleon" by Herbie Hancock and the Headhunters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbkqE4fpvdI Record: 4-1; Streak: 3 wins
@MountainMikes I’m not telling you how to do business, but I feel like your location in Utah needs to involve @MCONLEY10 and a purple mountain Jersey in a commercial soon.
Mike conleys been struggling so far good to see him break out of the slump
Just thinking about what Mitchell does in that 46 second clip. I would run through walls for that dude as a leader and role model.
Mconley is a bad man.
Captain clutch!
He was lights out in the game last night 
Thank you @utahjazz
@MCONLEY10 Good morning!
Hopefully you met @MCONLEY10! He’s no stranger to biomechanics. @MemphisBiomech @UofMHPCenter.

Hey @MCONLEY10 ... Let's get your Facebook page updated! After last nights performance, we need some "Mountain Mike" look to that page!! More Utah, less Memphis! Nice game last night! Keep it up! @utahjazz @vivintarena @spidadmitchell @rudygobert27
We were here in memphis waiting for our guy to show Utah what he did for us for so long he’s a complete stud
Lee, we have replied to your messages. Please refer us there.
STOP. my heart literally can’t take it. @spidadmitchell @MCONLEY10 #TakeNote
@MCONLEY10 thank you so much for your hard work last night......
Imagine my joy seeing you playing in the @utahjazz uniforms and on the court design I created 23 years ago for the Jazz when I was overseeing the most creative period in @NBA graphic design and team branding.
Se caen los @LAClippers
Jazz fans were not worried, and #MountainMike @MCONLEY10 showed us last night what we have to look forward to this season and it’s Glorious! #TakeNote #MountainTime
Told you @MCONLEY10 Utah has mad #TakeNote #MountainMike
Good morning, @MCONLEY10 #TakeNote
 ¡@MCONLEY10 lideró la victoria de los @utahjazz ante los Clippers con 29 puntos, 5 T3 y 5 asistencias! #TakeNote
Am I alone in thinking @MCONLEY10 has the most contagious smile? Great game last night! @utahjazz Keep smiling!
#MountainMike @MCONLEY10 
So glad he got his breakout game. Watch out NBA!!
“Cough” “Cough” coach I’m sick... sure
Porra...massa demais. Posta as fotos quando for. Hehe
Porra,massa que aí é mais em conta. Achei que fosse mais caro que isso. Vale a pena pra ver @spidadmitchell e @rudygobert27 e @MCONLEY10 

We'll take care of him. He's in good hands.
I gotta give it to ya...
About time the unlimited offensive capability of this “new” jazz team came to fruition. I love the team effort and it’s great to see @MCONLEY10 hit some buckets.
Official: Mike Conley baptized into the Utah Jazz. #TakeNote #mountaintime
