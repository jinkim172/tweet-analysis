So that should dictate what the biggest basketball league in the world does
Watch out for Rubio! Go Jazz!!!
Lolol
High school and college don't allow alternate colors. 
Good luck
Tonight we be will see why @MCONLEY10 is the better choice than @rickyrubio9 I do love Ricky though, once a jazzman, always a jazzman! #TakeNote
 
24% bro how about some game day shootaround
I expect you to drop 25+ points and 7+ assists tonight mate I need to you kill it for me in fantasy
#Focus
It’d look ridiculous if it was the same colour as the jersey
Let's keep it rollin baby! U and @44Bojan were great!
Let’s get it mountain mike!
Soo excited! And it’s my husbands birthday! Anxiously waiting until it’s game time
You got this Mike!
#letsgo
rip Ricky Rubio.
pues a ver si es verdad
Even @MCONLEY10 is excited about Game Day coming to Memphis. 
#gamedayfocus
Juanito tan joven y ya con esos problemas... asi no se puede!
One of the coldest throwbacks in the NBA don’t @me
Falacias
Can’t wait!!!
 
I give out names, and you can't have it. But I have something you can pull on.
This is money!!
So I guess what I'm saying in a nice way is, you ain't getting the Jazz name back so take note mfer.
I just know there are no Saints in N. Orleans. They all showing tits for beads, drinking 24/7 etc..... not saying this is bad but the name doesn't match, you should give it back.
Actually we should be the Saints, ain't no Saints in New Orleans.
Dicen las mala lenguas que al anfitrión se le complicó........ 
A todo esto, en que quedo el Jazzado? Entre tanta cosa acá y el inicio del season, se hizo algo?
Está fuerte la Peña del Jazz acá somos varios !
 Next episode of The Stepback coming tomorrow! @NBA #NBA #overreactions @KembaWalker @MCONLEY10 @JHarden13 @Giannis_An34

I'm surprised the jazz organization allows their players to wear @Jumpman23
23:00 PM
And not only is it an undershirt, but it's an alternate color to the uniform. First time in league history that they allow this.
 
Imagine if Knicks fans routinely utter racists epithets to players whom come to our arena?
And if they players want to wear them what’s the big deal lmao
No color. The pros just recently started to allow undershirts.
Aw shit thought it was a home game
What colour should the undershirt be?
It's really really weird not seeing my man @MCONLEY10 on the Grizz 100% will still support him though no matter what #classact
Hes in Phoenix 
 .. we love you more #Memphis
Just saw this 
So fresh, so clean.
Our boy @CJC9BOSS had your back tonight. Helping to heal the hurt. 
How you like the Viv, sir? 
Glad to have you in Utah!
Damn bro. Looking cleannnnnnnn.
This kinda hits me a good bit. Still miss @MCONLEY10 with the @memgrizz @MadeinMemphis1 #GNG forever
The CAT hoodie is the real!
Jersey FYE
Them jerseys so icy
Jerry jerry jerry !!!!
@MCONLEY10 you need to step your game up bro. You are killing my fantasy team. I drafted you with hopes of new team even better Conley.
Dumb heat
 
 
So glad you’re in Utah! Great vibe you brought! Hope your family loves it here!
Great job yesterday Mike ... Can't wait for the game tomorrow against the Suns #TakeNote
Except the damn advertisement
Ohhhhhhhhhhh ..... them 13s is FIE -ER !!!!!!!!
Even the Jordan’s? Kind of ironic, don’t you think?
Clean 
Throwback jerseys coming back strong this year and I couldnt be happier

Nice pic but the fans want to see the team come together ... I mean , Spida' #1 us player in the Olympics , Gobert the #1 center as well , plus Ingles was a mayor factor for Australias wins ... Really ?! There's got to be a way for them to be that force at JAZZ
This makes zero sense. Minneapolis Lakers went to LA where there are zero lakes. Nola Jazz moved to Utah where there is zero jazz, who cares?
LMAO this guy is dumb as rocks and disproving his own point post after post 

livinglereve would be very impressed unless she had something to do with it
They play in Minneapolis and so are the pelicans so I don’t get your point. They’re totally comparable
That was fun
I’m a big jazz fan but those are the ugliest jerseys we’ve ever had even though we want to pay homage to the teams of the late 90s. And that’s saying something in the history of a team that has puke gold and snot green for colors also
Gotta be nice, it's been snowing all day in Salt Lake
Yeah the timberwolves
Lakers played in Minneapolis
Carved this bad boy in honor of the amazing season we’re about to have! @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @MCONLEY10 @rudygobert27 @Joeingles7 @BucketsONeale00
@CJC9BOSS was the player I was most excited about getting in the @MCONLEY10 trade. 
yeah for 5 years, Utah has so much more history with the name
 mountain Mike
Still one of, if not the best, jerseys of all time!
That fit pretty live. But I’m not going to hype you up till your stats on the court pick up
Uh ok, wat was confusing ? 
Man you sure looked better of Beale Street Blue. :)
And Chicago got hella bulls running around
Now this is swag
Sheesh. This is a statement!
I like them shoes
Mane, you have moved to Salt Lake and have become soft. You wouldn't be allowed to walk around the M with that attire.
