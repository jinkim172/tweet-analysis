Initiations and hazing are just part of the #TakeNote way.
I told ya ! We believe in you
You are going to like it here. You enjoy egging on the crowd and we have a crowd who is happy to oblige! It’s going to be an awesome season! Go Jazz!
I feel for @MCONLEY10 Memphis became his home. Matured as a man there. Had some great years there. Didn't end his MEM tenure on his terms. Coming to Utah is an adjustment. But good times are ahead in Utah. Jazz fans are glad to have you Mike!
It is on! NBA #takenote #UtahJazz
Missed it today I was busy... but I do love all the Utah Jazz players @spidadmitchell @BucketsONeale00 @MCONLEY10 @rudygobert27 @StantonKidd11 @unclejeffgreen @Joeingles7 @emmanuelmudiay @GeorgesNiang20 @NigelWG5
Sounds like you don't have a defense other than that? Lmao overhyoed team.
Then tell doc to play them. Last I check Kawhi isn’t injured. Sounds like a personal problem. 
My husband and I waited in our seats for a few minutes after the game in the hopes that @spidadmitchell would do this. 
Mountain Mike had his angels with him last night! @MCONLEY10 @utahjazz
Les goooo
They’ll be a top 4 seed

We love you mike!
We caught up with Jazz Fans outside @VivintHome Arena to take their temperature after @MCONLEY10 big game. 
Look at who they played
Mike Conley it is a guy so amazing You know why??this player can make any moves when you defense him in the game.i still make a craze when he dropped a crossover..and I been still looking forward what kind of moves that's he made us
@MCONLEY10 @spidadmitchell you all were so fun watching last night!! I’m a long time jazz fan living in Nashville, TN where I run a non profit dog rescue @passion4thepack. I’m coming out to Utah at the end of January for the Mavericks and rockets game. Got any hook ups?
