Mountain Mike
Except why is the NBA now allowing alternate color undershirts and he's wearing Air Jordans, a player that stopped that franchise twice from winning an NBA championship. There are several things wrong. 
Love love love
 
Nah they need to change the name ain’t no Jazz in Utah . Give New Orleans back that name. Karl Malone made that cool.
he can’t even score ???
Except that it’s Mike Conley
Never going to happen. Miller’s made sure. If New Orleans wanted to keep it they wouldn’t have gotten rid of them.
 
 ..... now those light blue jerseys that D.Williams and those boys used to rock..... now those were it.
Good w bro but you gotta work on your shooting cuz
YES it is!!!
Not to me, Conley outside a Grizzly uni is weird for me.

That jersey is tuff! @utahjazz 
@Marcus_TOPNotcH
Nice 
Imagine if jazz fans did this to @MCONLEY10, thats rough. We are happy Mike is in Utah even with his offensive struggles the first couple games.
 
Bro those 13’s are absolutely fire!!!!! Purple suede touches? Bruh.
@ColeyMick CLEAN
Clean!!
Good work! Now put those unis back in the basement 
This take is so 2005
Mountain Mike! 
@MCONLEY10 @rudygobert27 @Joeingles7 are real champions @utahjazz
Don’t know shitt about basketball
Love what you bring to this team and organization Mike.
did someone say worst team debut in the league?? he don’t deserve to be wearing those laker 13’s
Love having you!
These are clean highkey
Those uniforms are comically bad. So 90s. But good for nostalgia. Great game!

exactly what we need to see from @MCONLEY10 tonight! 8 assists and 12 points and played solid defense as well, Great performance from Bogey as he went for 26 points after missing last nights game with an injury! quality team W (2-1) #TakeNote
Good job @utahjazz @MCONLEY10 you’re awesome!! So glad this game was a blowout. The offense looked amazing. Bojan is sooooooo good.
Y a pas eu match. Les mecs se sont venges d'hier soir. C'est garbage time maintenant.
Bof, il est qu'à 12, je pensais qu'on aurait un adversaire mais bon
Il va pas lui manquer beaucoup au final... C'est moche
