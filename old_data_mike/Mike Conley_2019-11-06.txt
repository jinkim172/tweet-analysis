Buy Low, Sell High: @Docktora recommends @Jrue_Holiday11 and @MCONLEY10 as notable 'buy-low' candidates. http://bit.ly/34yxUS8

Jazz nation is behind you Mike, go kick butt. I'm 37 and I want to be Mike Conley when I grow up!!
Is there an interview or article somewhere? 
Not worried
As long as you got that jazz on your chest, we got your back my guy!! #mountinmike
Damn I didn’t realize how tall you are
You got this Mike.
Do your thing Mountian Mike!
 
Foul is an incredible autocorrect in this context.
Jazz man @MCONLEY10 is here... going to have to try to not make a foul of myself 
@spidadmitchell @MCONLEY10
Wait-so Mitchell is trash?
We love you Mike!
Are you doing a story about their relationship & playing together with the @utahjazz on @espn ?
We got you, put them blinders on and play your game. I don't give a damn if it takes all year for you to find your way here. When we need you most, you'll rise up. There will be a shot, a moment, a play--that defines this season--and it'll come from your hand. You'll be ready. 
Signing day 11/13/19 12pm @LuHiBasketball #team122 #OhioState #Buckeyes @Dloading @KeyPlayerNation @daves_joint @MikeYagmin @RealiLuvBBall @MCONLEY10 
We are with you mountain mike man
No, but if the Romans were given $30 million I’m sure they’d expect to see abrupt and noticeable progress...
From @MCONLEY10 insta. @Joeingles7 asking the real questions.. Played pick-up ball with a kid wearing sweats, I dunno how he did it but I was dying in my shirt and shorts 
They both 6’1 bro
damn.. you are taller than them both 
Maria Taylor so fine with her white girls hair.
