Well you failed at that
Translation: All you MF haters who thought you were getting at me by voting for someone else, it didn’t even phase me! You can KMA!

Agree 100% let old school haters cry.
didn’t make a first team all defense till pippen got there 
But this is a league of all ages so no sympathy for the year 17 thing. Giannis should have this in the bag. But they’ll rob him bc lebron has a better story this season. Again, not taking anything away from Bron. He’s having a CRAZY season. He’s in the race, just not winning it.
The best don’t flop
You’re correct abt Walmart. What about @Nike which actually uses slave labor in China. Muslims are real slaves for their religious beliefs and forced to work in the factories making shoes. Why don’t you call them out? Why not you.. @KingJames ?@SteveKerr ? @ClayTravis
Get your girl @KingJames 
Yeah terrible idea...clearly worse than comparing the stats of someone that plays 35 mins vs someone that stuffs the stat sheet in only 29 mins! What was I thinking... But sure, lets not compare stats that would expose LBJ...
This team needed a little blood in the mix! #Cuse #LakeShow @KingJames
Giannis is still having an all around better season tho brother. Leads his team in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals etc. Also taking that he had not other SUPERstar, and they’re #1 in the league. The only argument about bron is he’s averaging 11 assist in year 17.
GOAT Waiters is home @KingJames 
For the culture!!!! Thank you @BarackObama @KingJames @kobebryant and the other GOAT who aren’t on social media!!! I’m hanging these at home I love LA + everything that’s Black Excellence 
@KingJames what are you and the NBA doing for the people of Nashville and the surrounding area?
vem ser feliz no mengao papai @KingJames 
@KingJames 
WELP U WILL NEVER B THAT EITHER
Check the +\- numbers when they both leave the court.... you’ll notice a trend. Lakers from 4th to 29th in efficiency when LeBron leaves. Giannis deserves MVP for sure but LeBron is still the best in the game
Lo que hay... El rey LeBron!!!

Jerry west lost 9, fake news
Now avail for pre-order! Lebron James @KingJames will release a kids book on Aug 11th called I Promise. It’s based on @LJFamFoundation program which provides tools and support kids need to stay in school. #IPromise will be publ by @HarperCollinsCa #NBA #Basketball
The same reason Giannis won last year..wins.. blame the voters for flipping the script
Bullied KD when he was palying with the Warriors, won last year, Dismandalled Clippers this year... yes La gonna blow out the bucks....lol
I know it’s not the dude in your avi tho
WTF @KingJames you fucking up now 
@KingJames novo coringa do mengão
Well we know you don’t watch any games
@KingJames how much help you need man? 
It is. Guy has me all figure through a tweet. What an amazing man this is everyone!!! The future is NOW.

My little brother made me this @KingJames lock screen and I am in love #NBAAllStar2020 #LeBronJames #LakeShow #StillABullsFan
Does me having $5 on you winning MVP help with the motivation? @KingJames
Lakers going to blow out the bucks? in what planet...Giannis is in beast mode everytime he plays in Califonia
Lebron put up back to back 41 point games and kyrie didn’t make the shot until bron made the block, and Lebron hit a free throw after, and led both teams in every stat
Stats lie
@KingJames 
" Nice!"

Has desprestigiado el deporte maldito seas @KingJames 
Instead they signed Dion Waiters lmaooo

J crossover is the truth 
@Lakers are set. No weaknesses. @KingJames about go off 
Stats don’t solely determine the best player on a team
L
The great Jerry Lucas, at the reunion of the @OhioStateHoops 1960 National Championship team, asked for his thoughts on today’s brand of basketball and specifically, the play of @KingJames. “I love the way LeBron plays. He plays the game the right way...he’s team first” 
Chasing ghosts since before 2003... I’ll always have the utmost respect for @KingJames for his competitive drive and his ability to still be a mentor to younger players. 
Got Dion already
This is what I dont understand they give Waiters a pass on his mistakes which is multiple and JR make one mistake and he dont get a pass .Not fair and JR keep your head up God got you and he will make a way even when it seems like he not .God got you !! 
2 games near the record ! Not bad
That’s his longest carry from scrimmage of the season? What a shit running back!
He got fucking finessed 17-18, had every stat better than harden (in totals) and didn't win, highway robbery
At his current pace and trajectory it looks like @KingJames might wrap up having the best career of any @NBA player ever. He would also rival best sports career at any sport.
lmao finally somebody who gets the feet right! he's got those goofy ass feet that stick out
aye @KingJames hear me out real quick... 
 No
Isn't winning the championship more important than winning the MVP award!? Keep talking about "who's the MVP." In the end, who cares? How about focusing on getting to the Finals. Let the national talking heads waste their time talking about that.
@KingJames 


Hey @KingJames my son, Brooks says good luck the rest of the way bring home the mvp and then the championship! #23 #kingjames
@KingJames clutch time 
better than bron
GIVE THT SOME MINUTES
why was i under the assumption we did? lmao
Stop man, just stop!!

the easy comparison is @KingJames as Stringer Bell. but as great as the King is idk if he is Stringers equivalent. #the #greastest #show #ever #made #of #all #time
@KingJames cuando tu quiera bro 
Then let's get him on the Lakers Lebron if you know you can go to him in a 911 situation.Please get them to sighn JR I miss yall chemistry, and hand shakes .
#EsteDeporteSeRespeta #AquiNoLeBronJames @KingJames
 u dey worry oo
Vamos ver 
@KingJames come remove your mouth
Someone pull up Gary's tweet from not too long ago that said he'd prefer Ben Simmons over Giannis.
He den am get the same agent
Gary with another bad take per usual. Time to get @itsCrab on the radio instead
 swing that he hungry @KingJames 
@KingJames Your practice and learning is top of the crop. My bro @delaniewalker82 did the same and the real pros know. Y’all 84’ babies good good. 
New word: conflictual @MerriamWebster
What? Hes a bad FT shooter...thats not a lie. He is statisically the worst shooter from the ride side of the court in the midrange spot, its all over twitter....its a fact at 32%. Lebron is a average at best, slightly below average mid range shooter his whole career.
Exactly, we talk about stuff with lebron we never talked about before him...like the East being weak or finals record...the west was stronger than the East in the 90s too and nobody ever said anything
The best team ever
Give a warning to @KingJames , he is the king of flops
He said check the box score and I did 
Imagine thinking shooting midrange meants 2pt% LMAO. People man. Look down below, Lebron his whole life been a average shooter at BEST LMAO. This year hes the worst shooter in the league at 31% in the right side of the court mid range. Its a fact.

@KingJames @darealjaymz just show me this. Boss upon all the begging i beg you say make you pick JR you nor do? Oh
Por suerte , si fuera anti lebrón jajajaja
On God!! 
Anthony Davis putting in extra work after practice w/ Lebron and Phil Handy. Post up work consisted of everything from counters after contact to facing up. Lebron is a great teammate! to stay after and help his brother is how championship teams are made @kingjames @antdavis23
Stick to soccer Chief
What is that durag for?
DIONNN
Yup Gary...the king of twitter trolling going at it again!! Dude just stick to football!!
He already wrongfully called himself the greatest ever. Why is he still playing?
Bring in Pierre Jackson so u can pick and roll from the same locations when Lebrons out of the game ( )
Too bad you’ll never make it, unless you play til you’re 45 years old! You’re better off trying to be close to Kobe or Pippen because you’ll never get close to Jordan, maybe in stats because you played more years then Jordan but just his style and finesse alone, how pretty it was
