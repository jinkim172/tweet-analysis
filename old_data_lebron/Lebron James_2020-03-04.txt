All this man gotta do is look at the ball before he takes the shot @KingJames 
Need a shot clock.

The flop killed me 
crlhouuuu, depois dessa eu ia pra casa e fodase, acabou ali meno, pra finaliza as batida pika
 
@soyleomontero el griego está en una forma increíble y lo que está haciendo cada vez que sale pero @KingJames está cerrando para MVP solo a dejado de jugar 3 partido.. 
@realDonaldTrump @kanyewest @KingJames @KimKardashian @IWashington @BrandonStraka @hrtablaze @ScottAdamsSays @RealJamesWoods @dpshow @Espngreeny @WhitlockJason @richeisen @ClayTravis @DrKarlynB
HAHA it does too!
@Kandi @TheEllenShow @KingJames @kimwayans
That's racist.
you're gonna need her to win the west @KingJames 
That ending! Perfect
Cringe
 
 I'm dead @ISendwe
I’ve said it before & i’ll say it again. @KingJames would be the greatest DB the NFL has ever seen 
@KingJames lol damn bron
The rhythm of this shot is similar as stepping to receive the ball on a catch and shoot. You locate the ball and pull. Also freezes the defense.
Not at all. Doesn’t Jordan get glorified for dropping 63 against the Celtics which they inevitably lost...... makes zero sense
@Angelo_columna
@WorldWideWob
It's not corrext
Hi Mav, can you DM me an email so I can send you the Greatest Hoodies Of All Time invention for @KingJames Thanks
That's embarrassing
False
I agree with that comment. It is a hypothetical, but we both know my answer is correct. Lebron comes out better. Mj Comes our worse. It’s simple
No lil guy, MJ efficiency is better on clutch shots. So MJ is more efficient, correct? Higher PER suggests that
Lebron and Bronny in 2023 #NBATwitter @KingJames @_BronnyJr @LakersNation
He still not better then @KingJames
@KingJames stole that logo shot from @KDTrey5 
Yikes
I’m going to praise him for dragging a team to the finals and dropping 51 against the most stacked team in NBA history
@HILG18 the end though! 
Ah, typical hypotheticals by Bron fans. Who knows, LeBrons teams are constructed to cater to his needs which are different than MJs
Legendary shot, looks like he travelled thou? @KingJames @ESPNNBA @NBAonTNT
Ending best part

Zero help in 2018. FACTS
Also probably the best ambassador for basketball in a generation.
So Jordan’s PER is literally a coupe decimals above. But Lebron is more efficient from 2 and 3 statistically, and has better efficiency on game winning shots.
You think names or a box score on paper determines value or if you're any good. Guys played their roles. No, he didn't have another star next to him his first stint, but he did have all stars & vets. What he did was incredible, not going to praise him for participation award
I LOVE @KingJames 
Lebron however. Is 8-0 if he played with Jordan’s teams against Jordan’s competition. It’s not even up for debate
@ceragresham
What would Jordan’s finals record be if he played Lebrons competition with Lebrons teams ?. 3-4 ? He wins in 2011. Doesn’t make it in 07 or 18 and loses in 16
@DownloaderBot
He had help, stop saying he had zero help
Its unstoppable 2
@BdotAdot5 has been doing these 
So let’s get this straight. Out of all these players. Lebron is the only one to make finals with absolutely ZERO help. Yet he RAN to Miami. NO, he gave 7 years to Cleveland and joined Miami after they failed to get him any support
*no footwork*
Hahaha Bron is absolutely not more skilled
find honest, black influencers who are trusted within the community or whole country and have them endorse you. @KingJames @michaelb4jordan @TheRock @DenzelWashngton @KevinHart4real
He literally is not more clutch or efficient. Guess you don't understand PER
So he can see the threads and get his hands right on the ball.
Making perfect sense. Wade was a proven winner, all NBA player. Every player needs help to win. Correct, 20 year old kyrie couldn't get the tanking Cavs to the playoffs. Love was playing in dysfunctional MIN. Now stuck.on the tanking cavs
If @KingJames looks at his right hand while dribbling just know he pulling that shot from where he stands 
I mean it's a 16 point game. This is just a "fuck it, why not" shot. No way is @KingJames taking this shot when tied or up 3 to 9 points.
Qwhite nice of y'all to keep giving these lame vids attention
@KingJames please let me go to prom with your son i will send a cover letter and resume if needed
@CNN @KingJames 
4-6 come June
Lebron is more skilled better iq more. LITERALLY STATISTICALLY MORE CLUTCH AND MORE EFFICIENT. YOU are just chatting SHIT at this point mate 
Established winner ? Didn’t wade have a decent Shaq and and Gary Payton ? What did wade accomplish from 2006-2010. What did Kyrie accomplish without Lebron his WHOLE career. What did Love accomplish without Lebron his WHOLE career. You’re making ZERO sense 
 
I think @SHAQ got you beat bro.. @KingJames.. Lol
Alright big fella chill @KingJames 
Bo-legged run kills me
You gotta do it the other way
Hilarious!
 
Never said celtics win the series, they win a few games. You said it yourself not every team sweeps every1
 
@Toots777
super dope bro
I agree
Sheeesssshhhhhh 
The end 
No you wouldn't. Hence why you're an idiot. LeBron has had more help to do less. I never said rings make a player better. MJ is more skilled/fundamental/efficient/clutch ect
@MattBizon
#100 RT @therealjrodjr: @KingJames @Lakers what shoes were you wearing last night against the 76ers? Looked sick #sneakerhead #LeBronJames #LakeShow #WITNESS
@Rjeff24 has always been trash at basketball @KingJames had to carry his sorry ass to a finals to win a ring what did you @Rjeff24 make the bench nice and warm lol he’s the last person to say some stupid shit like that 
No, MJ didn't. Yes, ran to MIA to an established winner in Wade, needed another all NBA player in Bosh to join. Then Ray. Got tough so ran back to clev with all nba player Kyrie there & needed All NBA love to be traded. Then needed more roster turnover
Is this @J_husk13 ? @brock_broughton !! Looks like him
Did the Celtics sweep every team. Did they win every season. Bulls. Magic lakers ? Every team loses time to time. But no one on that team guards curry or KD. Plain and simple. CELTICS don’t win. Zero chance
@KingJames 
@KingJames I wore 23 first in the purple and gold 17 years ago. I think i need an updated one though @Lakers #LeBronJames #lakers
@realDonaldTrump @kanyewest @KingJames @KimKardashian @IWashington @BrandonStraka @hrtablaze @ScottAdamsSays @RealJamesWoods @dpshow @Espngreeny @WhitlockJason @richeisen @ClayTravis @DrKarlynB
The best part about this is that we all can understand he is dressed up as LeBron without doing fucking blackface!
No they wouldn't. They didn't even sweep the clippers last year. Were about to lose to harden/cp3 until an unfortunate injury
Muthfuckas burning out the spot
GS didn't have 4 HOFers. Again, you're praising making the finals instead of winning. MJs east was more difficult. Imagine bron playing GS in the 1st or 2nd round. Sorry bub, wouldn't be in the finals
@ChipsDips1
The 2017-19 GS would sweep the Celtics. Not even up for debate
What was worth 50k+ likes? It’s not funny 
 
I really would. Hence why I whole heartedly believe Lebron is a better player. Is Havlicech better that Jordan because he’s 7/7 in the finals ?
This isn’t even exaggerating either, he is that dramatic and goofy.
You need some vitamin d . Too long winter in Ohio. These are funny as shit
