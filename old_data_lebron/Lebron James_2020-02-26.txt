.@KingJames will not play tomorrow against @warriors -- Anthony Davis is also probable per @Lakers https://twitter.com/Lakers/status/1232810187607527424
Only GOATs wear #6 for Team USA. @KingJames and @ACFresh21.
Where is @ACFresh21 ????
Rest up, @KingJames! Nice game last night! Can't wait to see you at again, #MVP

No, serán los poderosos Celtics

He deserves more minutes man.
Don't even compare. #RedVines
Wow drake really drank it
Red vibes are way better than twizzlers lol
 
Aun ni veo los goles sigo en la election por 2 horas mas pero tenia unas ganas enormes de terminar con la temporada del city en marzo en fin y la juve prefiero ya ni hablar me quedan @Simeone @KingJames y @PeteButtigieg
@KingJames please don’t sit out @New Orleans I’m coming from Alabama to see you
I am with @KingJames on this one all day people... @RedVines over @TWIZZLERS EVERY. SINGLE TIME.
@kingjames is too poor to put a price on my head 
@KingJames Wasup King James any chance we see the return of Lance Dance Stephenson

Josh Hart said
@KingJames and @Zionwilliamson #LakeShow
Why does Zion look fit but is so fat
 Facts
YOOOOOO @KingJames STOP IT 
MJ would most definitely do this if he was around today. The All-Star game isn't meant to be taken seriously..
Bron eating twizzlers Josh hart eating nuts
Is "hot ass" a good thing.. like "dead ass" or am I just not dumbing myself down enough?
T baggg
Drake's like "Igotchu"
At least we got 2 good guys in Lavine and White we can build off of tho 
And before 
 
So this is how lebron got his "sore groin" and couldnt play tomorrows game. Its your fault josh 
Bron basically did this but in the most disrespectful way Lmao
@ThisIsUD @KingJames and Ray Allen are next
His music still sucks
He's had some pretty good games though
Runnnnnn 
Yeah ok Joel... He's the Lebron of Hip Hop music
one condition: only i may have access to: @KingJames beta 
 nuts on his face #hegotnutsacked

@KingJames @Drake @KevinHart4real
@DanielGofflot
I’m a little late to the party but @KingJames needs a hardcore reality check. Redvines are trash and Twizzlers are king. #WednesdayVibes #Lakers #LeBumJames
@KingJames The money ain’t worth it if imma die right after
smh RT @LAGalaxy: City of Stars. @KingJames x @CH14_
You dropping any @DelStateUniv gear?
Aye my fault @KingJames you bein real subtle with what u mean wit these huh? 
Shedding some tears @KingJames Was really really excited for my first time seeing you live 
A los 35 años, 17 temporada en las costillas y aún vuela y corre como un chamaquito...#thegoat #theking #thenba @kingjames en Santo Domingo - República Dominicana https://www.instagram.com/p/B9DJFMyJ18Y/?igshid=p7gj6hxjy6t4
Twizzlers all day

Not really when its set up come om man
I am looking forward to this series. It will be good.
Oh, lawd. 
For real 
The ref face 
 
I was at the game in OKC @KingJames I need tickets for LA 

 @KingJames 
Leído
These comments show why he shouldn’t run. White people refuse to accept him because of skin color first. Then it’s going to be the education thing second. But the president now can say and do the fucked up stuff to all Americans and it’s ok?? 
Stole?
It's the G-League Warriors. Well-deserve rest @KingJames.
You can’t see from this angle but Harts mouth is just as open
Year 17...amazing
Its gotta be onsite for Hart...gotta be
Yikes bro that’s straight dick on face
Lmao the exact definition of “he put his nuts on his head” 
Wearing it like a badge of honor
Everyone's reactions around them cracks me TF up 
Love love vibes
 
@KingJames
Most valuable point guard in the NBA not named @KingJames 

Wow 
there’s still time to delete this
Where's the pic dude???
Bryan!!!! That is uber kind of you, sir!!! Truth is, I fail all the time...but I learn more when things don't work! I read a really great quote from @KingJames as I walked into the studio to take the test: “You can’t be afraid to fail. It’s the only way you succeed."–LeBron James
He got to frame that 
See you in NOLA! 
BI was always going to be a star. Anyone who thought otherwise didn’t watch
Maybe if his shorts were off
Jesus @KingJames he has a family 
Both would have to see me 
That’s a red vine you can tell by how stiff it is lmaooo
Rondo Bradley Green Kuzma Howard KCP Caruso Dudley M. Morris Mcgee

@Walmart

Josh Hart on explaining why #LeBronJames was in his Pie hole what happened was
