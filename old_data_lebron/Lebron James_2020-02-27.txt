Make it happen @Lakers @KingJames 
Pippen took awhile and you said all star teammates when Lebron not only played and begged to play with all stars but they were franchise players. You sound like a Lebron apologists which is typical. MJ has never played with a franchise player nor a player that avg 25ppg.

Ima Heat fan so I’m biased towards our jerseys but after ours those sleeved Cavs ones were tuff idk if it’s cause of what happened in them or the look itself but those jerseys are nice
@KingJames LeBrandon!!!!!! I hope this connection happens
@KingJames let’s make it happen 
@KingJames 
When we running them duos? 
@KingJames @Lakers
Lies. They’re faster in some cases but doesn’t mean better. Half can’t shoot and don’t play defense. Hell Lebron can guard today’s centers and PF’s cuz they only weight 225-250 except a few he can’t guard. Big difference than it was back then as he would be put on his ass a lot
@getnickwright jealous asf right now
