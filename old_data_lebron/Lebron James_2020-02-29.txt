There's literally a link in the tweet that gives all the context you need.
LA legends @KingJames : @Lakers
Respect for Jackie
Does that link donate the proceedings to the mamba and mambacita sports foundation? Because Quinn cook had partnered with active dreamers to make sure they are donated.
No lie, I was hoping big homie @KingJames would sit this one out. We did good the other night, we need a chance to prove that we can win against playoff caliber teams without him too. bron shouldn’t even travel with the team! Stay home and recover. Sleep &amp; Massages all day only!!
