Ala verdad que no entiendo no pero nada entiendo

#WashedKing @KingJames! 
@Oliviathenoir disseste que podiam dar a Westbrook 
Right!?!? He literally stops dribbling and shoots. Is this the skill that guys like Harden need to learn?
Yo con el abrazo de @KingJames ya soy feliz 
@RealSkipBayless has no idea what his talking about, his the biggest joke on tv. All this man does is talk about kawi, he hated him and as soon as he looks like he can’t stop lebron from winning a title then his back to loving him. Pls @KingJames. do it for Kobe
Yikes
He was good enough to hit a series saving three. Bosh bron wade and Allen are all hall of Famers. That's 4. When you're the 4th option you don't need to be in your prime to contribute what's needed... experience and knock down shooting.
Need a hoodie like this with that @KingJames poster dunk over @jasonterry31 https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1234990292102598656

Whatta fuck is that. That's he's best move lol I never seen something like that Horrible fake 
Proves my point he hit more 3’s but only did it on 5 less shots so stop being so dramatic. If he shot a bad % talk sh*t, otherwise you have no point to make
literally less than a week ago. missed one game against Houston and that’s it
Literally still shoots 33%. Hes not good
Yessir! 35 years of age & still doing this?! It’s crazy IMO.
U mad?
@Stacey21king Love your take in the background of this. #SeeRed
Yeah, you just proved my point lol
Treino.
Never seen @KingJames or @AntDavis23 play live! I got tickets for Tuesday’s game vs Brooklyn! I’m hoping they both play that night!!!!
@this_vid please
Man he has enough MVP’s lol why does he need another one...the only thing left for him are championships
and yea he went 5-15 one game but he also shot 49.4 percent from the field and 48.1 percent from deep in February. Beal shot 47.5 percent from the field and 36.5 percent from deep that 12 percent difference from three really sold it imo
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times - Bruce Lee
???
@patrickkarnezis 
How many wins he have?
Tatum and a fan.
What do you use?
走好
Where's the flop? You attached the wrong video. #KingFlop
Ha! They owe him one for 2011 anyway. 
#godukes #golakers
Westbrook deserved it more
These new moves BEND the rules is he not lifting his foot and moving n traveling like its like Hardens shot just looks suspect
NBA record for most all time 
 
which two? i only see one?
What movie or episode is that? Who’s the villain?
Russell Westbrook got robbed
I’ll be doing that at the rec league tomorrow. You can count on it 
No hate my nigga bro doing these in year 17 Crazy
Actually, he’s been looking at a lot of old videos of Booker T from back in the day...before started popping in his shots.
Man what an impressive extremely skilled move. Wow! This is amazing by the .
He should've had 5 or 6 MVPs by now.
So were the lakers

Tatum started getting double teamed all the time this month
Boy Russ is not on bron level
Always liked Kobe better. Kobe could run his mouth all day and still get respect because he played balls out. Still weird still seeing Lebron in Kobe colors. Don’t like it.
 
He legit looks at the ball every time and shows you what he’s about to do lol that’s cold ! 
Nothing about that foot work is elitie, yikes 
Sencillo @Lakers @LosLakers @KingJames 
Damn dude on your ass
This is siiiiiick! Signature move. @mrmbrennan
.
No todas pegan, no seas forzado
Curry did 54 points in 2013 (Vs Knicks) at 18/28 FG (so 64,3% FG)
4.8TOs vs 5 whew! Barely had better percentages, barely a better record,lost against worst teams.
Kemba missed half the month
 foh Russell Westbrook should’ve been WC player of the month
@CameronFyles
de hecho no, esta muy adhoc el tweet a la publicación

Rock you to sleep, then Bang!

2nd round contending team* Celtics are AT BEST winning 1-2 games in the 2nd round. Stop with This championship contending BS lmfao
Where did he shuffle tell me the second count on the video he shuffles his feet please show me
Forzado
he gotta stop doing this 
A Lot Of Times We Lost Games Because Of This Shot Smh I Can’t Believe This Is A Thing Lol.. It’s Not That Consistent Yet
he stares at the ball right before he does it lol not that hard to recognize when it’s comin

Russ had better percentages, better record, better PPG. Bron lead assists, TO, rebounds,lool. C'mon man. You see my point? It should have been Russ's
27,8,10 basically a triple double
This song reminds me of @KingJames This is most definitely his theme song this year #lebronjames #jamesgang #lakers #LakerNation #LakeShow #nipseyhussle #tmc
Fair enough. It still seems like more of a "tell" than a juke. Not sure what the benefits are. You know he is about to make a decision when he freezes and looks at the ball.
That’s a shot not a move. Show him flopping. That’s his signature move.
thanks for the scouting report dumbasses
Facts CP 

Imagine
Just bad defense tbh why anyone won't pick him up at 1/2 court shows this
U sound silly when curry would score modt of those from 3 ofc. Its about the fg % not the shots taken
@KingJames bro before you retire, we need you to break your career high 61 points while playing for the @Lakers
MVP
Russsssssssss
As a laker fan I've seen him miss this like every time when it matters I'd like his signature move to be drive to the whole because nobody can stop him
Leads the league in creating his own drama
The right is for Russ yeah? You're making my point for me,lool. 33.6 PPG, that ridiculous 
You mean stock photos? Yeah I guess I have SERIOUS sexual issue
Lol this guy @lakers @KingJames what is he smoking yo !!!! There years away 
King Move? King Step? LeBron Move? @KingJames (via @NBA)

It’s good because he drives and passes from the same move . Like instead of shooting he does a bounce pass to a cutter or instead of shooting or passing he drives and gets an easy layup
Videos and pic of boys in ur camera roll ? Yikes . U have some SERIOUS sexual issues
Shoulda been Russ
Imagine losing to the knicks I’m dead imagine having a player who attempted more FT shots then FG shots in there career
