@KingJames keep speaking to the young, though you may be criticized, to do your best is what is necessary, keep showing courage.
I was just trying to find +\- for the Lakers when he is on the court vs on the bench
Con el puto @KingJames
there’s a difference between all-star and superstar idiot, middleton is not a superstar
Aunt
@KingJames @Team_CK7
They could not have traded him, unless he was in agreement!
Yo wtf
My man @KendrickPerkins with some truth! The same energy ain’t there for Giannis because everyone hates @KingJames simple as that. 
If @KingJames wins a chip for the @Lakers ill definitely getting a tattoo
@KingJames #SLAVE LABOR IN CHINA WITH NIKE WILL MAKE ME A SLAVE LABOR OWNER TURNED BILLIONAIRE! #LEBRON DO YOU PAY FOR SLAVE LABOR KIDS WHEN THEY GET SICK OR DO YOU JUST SEND THEM AWAY AND GET A NEW SLAVE LABOR CHILD? #NIKE HELPS BUT DO YOU MANAGE YOUR SLAVES BY FORCE OR BY MONEY
That’s because the bad boy’s were drawing blood. Different league now. Stare someone down get a flagrant one.
Lol check the bucks record against the west, 19-4. Giannis beasted on both LA teams.
Gianiss must be playing golf @KingJames sit this one out 
Player option
Great point...I’m mean what’s the meaning of MVP !!! @KingJames is my vote !!!
why do we say that the east was weak when @KingJames was the REAL MVP of the NBA but now that @Giannis_An34 is hoopin the east is strong???
@KingJames #SLAVE LABOR IN CHINA WILL MAKE ME A BILLIONAIRE AND BUYING SLAVE CHINA KIDS CHEAP IS BEST MARKETING COST WISE JUST DON'T GET CAUGHT! HOW MANY SLAVE LABON KIDS DO YOU OWN?DO YOU PAY YOUR SLAVE NIKE LABOR CHILDREN ALL THE SAME OR DO YOU GIVE THEM CHANCE TO SLAVE RETIRE?
Top 3 ....he’s having the most efficient season EVER, remove that from the bucks and they finish 6-8. Y’all gotta stop disrespecting this man he’s about to win 3 straight MVPs maybe 4
Keep throwing up and listen to the man 
We miss you Kobe Bean, it’s not the same anymore 
NBA is F UP!!! but guess what??? They can kiss LBJ ass with a smile!!! They tried for years to hype Giannis bt it didnt work. Now they trying with Zion but Not ready yet!! @lakers @KingJames
Hell ya Bron
Giannis will not let it happen
Giannis doesn’t have a second superstar like lebron does with ad
@KingJames #REAL RACISM EXISTS IN LEBRON BUSINESS HE LIVES OFF OF MILLIONS OF SLAVE LABOR DOLLARS AND HIDES IT WITH HIS MR GOODY GOODY LOOK AT ME I CAN MAKE A SHOT BUT I CAN'T SHOT A GUN HUNTING BECAUSE I AM SOCIALIST AND I LEBRON JUST LIVE OFF SLAVE LABOR FOR MILLIONS!
2nd year is an OPTION YEAR, so they still count it last year AND this year as back-to-back 1-year Rentals. Learn the Rules.
How @KingJames stays so silent is truly amazing. This Harasser has had a bullseye on Lebrons head since the 2nd grade! What’s really good @RealSkipBayless?? Tell us what really happened?!
@KingJames #KING CHINA KING SLAVE LABOR OF CHINA SLAVE MONEY CHINA MAN LEBRON RIPS AMERICA OFF AND LAUGHS WITH NIKE THAT THE SLAVE WORKERS NEVER GET!

Pals? Strangers? @KingJames? I’m co-hosting a podcast about sports scandals with my bud @rachelbonnetta. It’s called Hall of Shame and launches with @crookedmedia next week. Please subscribe. http://crooked.com/hallofshame Thanks in advance to all of you and LeBron!
I wonder if some voters will see the low minutes per game as a bad thing tbh
With all respect Stay in the lane that was created for you, you couldnt handle seeing or feeling half the things of the black community. you exit is next
Foul Or Flop? LeBron James Is Allegedly Fouled By Dillon Brooks During Game Against Memphis Grizzlies! - https://go.shr.lc/2Twpres via @Worldstar #WSHH #WORLDSTAR !! This flop king wants to talk about cheating!!! Lol @KingJames
At full speed can’t say the first frame is a gather step. 3 steps yes. But let’s not pretend this isn’t a problem with everyone in the nba. Let’s consider a look at the nba ‘step back’
Nice!
Well the east is significantly weaker y’all forgot about that tho when Bron left
They need someone who can make 3's, run the pick&roll, with our Bigs, to create mismatches, and get the other team into foul trouble..
Now I’m deff not getting anything signed by @KingJames due to the corona virus... damn. Lol
@KingJames and @saquon
You called me a casual because I pointed out that him playing 23 minutes and 54 seconds of a series is not valid evidence to show his dominance?? Wow
The crazy thing is when LeBron was doing that with Cleveland, he got no love cuz the East was “weak” but we forget that narrative now #LBJMVP
Yo no les vi, joer
Any option on this @KingJames @Kaepernick7 or @SteveKerr?
No, Giannis will take it.
GET IT TOGETHER!!
Bu sorunun muhatabı > @KingJames 
Wrong, it's storyline of the year. LeBron has been the most valuable player in the league for years now - CLE without him would be a lottery team at best. A case can be made for harden a few years, but that's it.
Who cares about the mvp. Regular season award that is more of a team award then individual award
Don’t start this
I went from lovin’ Lebron to hatin’ Lebron to lovin’ him again. Stand up guy on and off the court, Great role model to the youth. @KingJames keep goin champ that 5th mvp comin’ #LakerNation #RIPKobe
Hence “value” not MSP (most skilled player)
No but you genuinely dislike Lebron (according to your twitter feed) so there’s quite a bit of bias going on. It says a lot that Bron is 35 and people still consider him an MVP caliber player, that’s not bs I’m sure...
Cause a lot of people wanna ride lebrons cock. MVP isn’t the best player on the team, it’s the most valuable player to their team. AD is higher contender than lebron cause AD is young and talented, YET he has so much more potential to grow and get better
@KingJames
How many games left? And Giannis is a lock for MVP??... We ain’t got love for the West Coast??... Can we get some @KingJames MVP consideration talk??... please and thank you! #nbamvp
@nadal_abudayyeh peep how he putting these tweets out hoping he don’t get cut 
But @KingJames can fake a foul 
Hes NOT a spot-up shooter.. , he's a scorer..
Ridiculous
29th offense btw
@KingJames 

@BlazePizza @KingJames How would you like to $ell more #BlazePizza? I have a wonderful idea!!! @Michelle_TCL1 #Solutions
@ESPNNBA @NBAonTNT @SteveKerr @KingJames @ScoonTv @LegendaryEnergy @Timcast Pathetic that cultural icons bow and scrape for @nikestore @nikebasketball and China but think they should lecture others about politics https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale
Frank Ntlikina, Mitchell Robinson, etc etc

He got injured by Zaza but had the greatest team in NBA history down 20+ points at home. Foh casual
As he should
I‘m not gonna argue anymore with somebody that doesn‘t even watch the games and is just repeating the mainstream hater-opionions If i rem correctly LeBron‘s DEF RTG this season is his best since 2013 or so. But yeah, keep talking. I‘m not gonna answer anymore 
 
Taught: if they're older then...you better put a handle on it...be respectful always...
Kawhi played like 25 minutes that series Dont come on the internet just to say stupid things 
She’s a little sass and a lot of badass.. @kingjames pic (who needs a wall?!) to my sista @cassi_hoe #theville @Greenville Inn https://www.instagram.com/p/B9P_9aFJzK6/?igshid=1o9c3xxcmyz7z
Nice tutorial http://gestyy.com/w8T6oOhttps://youtu.be/4VvSb4SeZR0
um... did giannis stop existing???
Lmao.. So.. KCP's 2-year 16mil, + player option +veto trade * = consecutive 1 year deals..?
Both can be true
Giannis for sure deserves it. But I see a lot of people saying Lebron should win, yet he's playing with a top 5 player and those same people said KD and Steph would never win an MVP on the same team.
Bron isnt top 4 lmao
How can you #hypocrites support #Nike? @KingJames @Kaepernick7
Clark Kent with the assist
@KingJames
He not smiling
Im talking about 2017 Spurs vs Warriors, clown
What? Lebron has played his arse off this year..
I'm for giving giannis a 2nd MVP but I clearly understand why some people would give it to LeBron (and I would love to see it but I think giannis deserve it a bit more)
I thought me and graves were buddies I guess something happen between us.
I hate that for this season it’s do it for Kobe for the lakers and if we do go out and win the trophy people gone start saying it’s “rigged” lakers can’t win worth nothing “watch “ @Lakers @espn @KingJames
ザイオン選手@Zionwilliamson は豪快なダンクを決め、レブロン選手@KingJames はこの距離からのスリー #NBA #NBAStoreJP #NBAストア
The NBA is at an all time low wow
Hol up, theyre calling Middleton a superstar and ignoring the difference AD is making 
@KingJames traveled. Of course he made it to the rim
Perkins not taking anything away from those guys. All he saying is when LeBron won it in the East it was a problem because the East was week when in reality it is not strong right now either. It had nothing to do with the players but you have to be fair
The trade helped us free up cap space. So, we probably couldn’t sign JJ without the trade that helped us move Solomon’s contract.

Why do people keep acting like harden doesn’t play defense when he has to? Harden led the league in deflections last year which shows that he’s putting some effort on that side of the ball
The dude is literally walking around and not playing D. And his fans have been saying the same thing "I want him to preserve himself" Y'all really gotta get together and figure out which way you're going to stan from day to day.
I knew you'll talk about curry. And that's why this 2016 MVP is so amazing, curry just broke the whole league. And he's the only one to achieve it (sorry shaq)
Victor Oladipo, Malcolm Brogdon or TJ Warren would be amazing!! Great work here
