Knicks
Talent for talent they won. They got many peak Melo years. Mismanaged billups contract and never played Corey Brewer, they waived him.
Eh what’s a “win” when you did all that look at the repercussions of the trade the Knicks FUCJING suck
That’s true but they still won the trade.
No doubt lol but I was hyped
@carmeloanthony what a wonderful day this was nine years ago! #stayme7o #staymel00
They did Carmelo still can't pass
I remember Melo saying don't give away the farm he'll be there in the next summer without giving anything up
Murray isn’t anywhere near the level of where Melo was during that first contract extension. The killer thing was trading 9 for Bargs smh

Love #Melo but it was awful move.
For selling merchandising and make money (which is the only thing Knicks owners want) Carmelo was better, but Denver Nuggets is a real team
If melo would of waited just half the season they wouldn’t of had to give up every talent on the roster
Also got Chauncey Mr Big Shot Billups who they used the amnesty clause to cut the next year. Knicks got by far the two best players even 9 years later
Could have amnestied Amare and waited for CP3 instead of adding Chandler...
Is it sad that feels like the “good old days” now?
Knicks.. we gave then Felton, moz, chandler , gallinari... did any of those guys do anything special there.. murray is above avg pg nothing special. That team is all about jocker. Rest are side kicks
@RealDealBeal23 @AntDavis23 @KingJames @jaytatum0 @carmeloanthony You guys are my locks for fantasy tonight... it’s my Birthday can you please bring me that good luck?!?!
Same as when it happened. Nugs
@carmeloanthony This Towson U player goes by MELO. She is so good 
Nuggets. Melo was gonna come to the Knicks anyway in free agency, we could’ve just waited a little longer without giving up assets
Not sure it’s as simple as win/ lose... I will say this the biggest loser was Donnie Walsh and in that respect when we lost him, the Knicks lost overall.
@carmeloanthony we need you to turn back the clock tonight 
Yea but melo didn’t want to wait for free agency ... he was gonna accept a trade to the Nets if we didn’t make it ... but yea in hindsight we Probaly would’ve been better off just being patient and letting Walsh work
There’s no way paying nearly $200 mil for a guy to lead you to one playoff series victory in 7 seasons is a win. Especially after giving up young players AND multiple #1’s. I tried to tell Knicks fans THEN, it was a horrible trade.


@Palinarcher
It wasn’t a great trade but it wasn’t a horrible trade, but the moves they made afterwards like amnestying billups and getting Tyson Chandler after Chris Paul said he was coming here at Melos wedding.
By every measure the Nuggets won the trade. They won more games, made more playoffs, had most wins in a single season. Nuggets retained flexibility, drafted Murray & didn't deal w/ Melo's many superstar issues that hamstrung the team for years.
Getting Melo was important but they shoulda waited til free agency. Sure the risk of losing him entirely was there but the fall back plan coulda been re signing Wilson Chandler and then going after Chris Paul
 
 
I mean, it's still the Knicks. Mismanagement comes with the territory. ;)
Denver set up the better for the long term, look at their roster and #Knicks roster
Leaning towards this
What did the Knicks give up? Gallo, trash and pics. Have you seen what packages for all stars look like?
Then they opted into his contract and amnestied him. Though that provision came out after the lockout. Still totally mismanagemed that situation.
This tweet is incredibly disrespectful to one of the best players in NY Knicks history.
They won
That’s just crazy talk, sir. The only way that trade makes sense today is if Dolan just woke from a 9 year coma.
Knicks also got Chauncey Billups in that deal giving them a solid point guard which they were lacking.
Wins scoring title in 2012-3, Knicks #2 seed, win first playoff series since 2000. All on his back. Garnett pulls his arm out of his socket. Tyson Chandler, known for his defense, is somehow unable to stop Roy Hibbert and the team crashes out in Round 2.
Gallo was the only piece that became anything. FRPs are always a crapshoot. This trade happens again today, and every GM does it.
You make that trade again today.
Who won? Lmao are you joking? We traded our entire starting 5 half our bench and 27 picks for a guy who would of signed in free agency a few months later.
The Knicks. They failed to capitalize but they won the trade piece vs piece. Did they overpay? Yes but still won it.
Y’all gone hear it from me now. @carmeloanthony will be in his bag tonight 
Let’s #fangirlflashback to nine years ago today when @carmeloanthony was traded to the @nyknicks. What a day! Let’s get a W for Melo tonight! @Madison Square Garden https://www.instagram.com/p/B81tyzKF_w2/?igshid=1kyaeg5m57j0h
You do remember the NYK had Gallinari and Wilson Chandler at the time, rite? Waiting to add Melo via FA would’ve made bettter sense, then and in hindsight.
Not the Knicks ... and I can almost guarantee we wouldn’t have picked Murray anyway .. look at our track record with draft picks lol I still love Melo hands down my favorite player, I’m a NY guy tho, Syracuse etc
Not everyone. Some of us were wondering why the NYK drained the draft/young players on the roster for a cat they could’ve signed in FA a few months later.
I have and forever will be a @nyknicks and @carmeloanthony fan! Loved the trade hated we gave up a lot but it brought a player who wanted to be here ! Hate to see Walsh go he was doing great things in NY
Denver Easily
Remember this like it was just yesterday. Damn how time flys by
The beginning of the end. Cost them Donnie Walsh
That trade was the focal point of Nix 21st century catastrophe. Gallinari, among others was also included in that deal. It sent a clear message that a fool such as Dolan was making the decisions, as opposed to a respected executive, Donny Walsh. DOLAN S***S & SELL THE TEAM!
Knicks did way more with Carmelo than they would have done with the things they traded away for him. Tough to say denver “lost” tho cus they managed it well.
Everyone. Knicks got a star to pair with Amare. Denver got to kickstart their rebuild. Melo wound up where he wanted to be all along in New York City.

lol not us

@carmeloanthony Good morning,Carmelo,stay cool,your friend and cuz,Willie Starks
@SeanMarksNetsGM hello again! I hear @KyrieIrving is out for the season! We need some help here! We missed out on @carmeloanthony, so why not sign @isaiahthomas! He’s ready and available! That’s a thought! Let’s not give up on the season!
@carmeloanthony 
Now we need a consistent 3rd scorer. We have almost 50 points out for the rest of the season. In hindsight we should've signed @carmeloanthony
Big @SHAQ @carmeloanthony the last person sealing people in the post
