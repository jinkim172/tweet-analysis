I found the concrete Island on Kixify. I just love them. If it's not my size I have to buy the 11 size. All I did is collect yours. Never wore them. I'm just a big collector!!!!I want to get the Famous Nobodys collection too with you.
“You get one Sunday”... Melo always supportive man, where did this bad teammate narrative came from?? #stayme7o @KingJames @carmeloanthony 
Cuando tenga los mismos millones de @carmeloanthony (?) me mando a hacer un cuadro así. 
@aYo_Austin when he finally gets to meet @carmeloanthony one day. 
I had a dream that because of my actions (or lack thereof) @carmeloanthony, @HoodieAllen, and @markiplier all got gunned down. @blumhouse got me fucked up with #FantasyIslandMovie
Hi
@multiexchangue Very good project!! @angelo_arturo @enriqueborges13 @carmeloanthony
Those AZGs have aged well. I hated them at first.
happy valentine’s day @carmeloanthony 
That’s badass! Totally forgot about that play.
Best purchase I’ve made in awhile @carmeloanthony 
That sounds very similar to Harden's case for MVP last season. Look It's not the other guy's fault his comps shortcomings. You work with what you have and so far CP has done more with the guys he's been given. A squad who was expected to tank and buy at the deadline btw.
booker's played less than 10 games with his whole starting lineup ayton was out 25 games and the suns were still in contention for the 8 seed until rubio and saric got hurt
That's where impact becomes a conversation. It's JUST numbers that get you into AS talks. Booker's playing well but look at his teams ranking. Compare that to everything CP does for OKC INCLUDING performance, it's not as close as it seems at 1st glance.
Pourin up sum juice...spill sum drank on my Melos...@carmeloanthony
This how my @carmeloanthony jersey collection is they wouldn’t sell me the hawks one
