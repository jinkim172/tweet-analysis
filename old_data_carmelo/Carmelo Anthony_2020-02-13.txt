Time to mute this conversation...
4 pictures that define Melo’s first half of the season It’s great having you back, @carmeloanthony #STAYME7O
@jdfromny206 guys give jd a follow. Great guy.
Yeah, but Gruden said they wouldn't trade Mack and I'm pretty sure someone with the Chiefs said Peters was not up for trade right before they traded him as well.
I’ve read GM says it’s not true.
Good...God!
Man among boys
@Jumpman23, Wilt, @DwyaneWade @KevinGarnett5KG @carmeloanthony
If he’s traded it would be hilarious to watch this guy lose his shit.

Not sure why you unblocked me after blocking me for the second time. So what are you "sources" saying about the Lions trading "the best QB in football"?
Expert on Everything The first Players Alternative Podcast features Antoine Hood. The former Air Force Academy Alum tells some great stories about defending Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson as a rookie with the Denver Nuggets. Available 2/20/20! @carmeloanthony @alleniverson

On My Kobe Ish I call it GOOD DAD SHITTY SITUATION 1st Daughter in school my 2nd Daughters in da back with melo hoodie and 3rd Daughter is the Situation LoL #Blessedness @LakersNation @kobebryant @carmeloanthony @HulkHogan #GoodDad #kobebryantchallenge #Daddydaycare

You mean like you guys calling Mahomes "average"? Does News 4 in Detroit lie a lot? Seems to be a lot of smoke here.
lol both of them blocked me again as well
And @carmeloanthony
Fake news! @_lionheart41090
Lmao
You might want to ask Perdue why they would consider trading "the best QB in the NFL". I would, but he blocked me again.
What do @carmeloanthony and @PaulaAbdul have in common? They've both worked with Jessica Cohen -- a graduate of the @uacoehp Athletic Training program and one of only a handful of female athletic trainers working in the NBA! @JessicaCohen2 https://colleague.uark.edu/2020/02/u-of-a-alumna-jessica-cohen-among-select-few-female-athletic-trainers-in-the-nba/
 @carmeloanthony la nuit dernière… • 15 rebonds captés : son plus gros total depuis décembre 2015. • 1-15 aux tirs (6,7%) : son pire pourcentage de réussite aux tirs en 1 104 matchs disputés en carrière (minimum 10 tentatives au shoot). Méli-mélo.

Solid gotta uplift and invest in our Queens! @carmeloanthony real man move boss. 
Loved this team! 
I just hope he's okay
Best Cuse player all time.
Yes! The good ole days.

Melo was unbelievable.

@carmeloanthony Bro I was the guy in the second row Screaming Your Name &amp; I know you heard me!
Take a moment to realize how cool this is... think about the history of the @BIGEASTMBB with players like @alleniverson @KembaWalker #RayAllen &amp; @carmeloanthony; the All-Time Leading Scorer is @markushoward11 from @MarquetteU #mubb #wearemarquette
@carmeloanthony
@carmeloanthony We need that same energy from last year , we need player of the week Melo, you was efficient and you played super hard defense. Now get to work God Melo bring it every game no excuses stayMelo!
@carmeloanthony Don't stop playing with that #Fire and chip on your shoulder, don't lose your EDGE. #STAYFOCUS and get up extra 3s and midrange shots your game is OFF. Stay hungry stop missing open 3s tonight was horrific. Don't force the game just let it come naturally.
Probably still grieving sis
No worse feeling than watching your TEAM - @nyknicks and your player - @carmeloanthony lose two straight heading into All-Star weekend/Week off.. I just want both of them to succeed man, this sucks! Forever and ALWAYS loyal though #StayMe700 #NewYorkForever
@carmeloanthony What is up with your 3pt shot? The past 2 weeks your entire game has been off, I don't know what is going on with you but you need to get up extra 3pt shots. You are missing wide open practice 3s. Your 3pt shots are too hard, you shoot with too much power!
https://youtu.be/6f6O32ZBlhQ please come back @carmeloanthony what happened to u??
Are you serious? @carmeloanthony 1-15 I still love you 
I hate you @carmeloanthony why do you do this to me man 
@carmeloanthony Retire by Midnight https://twitter.com/Zardawg/status/1227794527940993024
@youngwhiteside and @carmeloanthony completely let down RIP city in the last two games taking off while chunks of time throwing up stupid ass shots and getting their feelings by a couple rookies pull your heads out of your asses post AS break
@carmeloanthony You sir can not play basketball. 1/15. #retire
Good to know @carmeloanthony is consistent in big games #trash

If there’s one guy that honestly deserves a nba championship it’s @carmeloanthony
