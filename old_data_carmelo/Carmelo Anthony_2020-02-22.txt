I miss Melo on the Knicks @carmeloanthony
On this date in 2011: Carmelo Anthony was shipped from the @nuggets to the @nyknicks in a blockbuster deal changing the course of both franchises. @carmeloanthony is a 10x all star, 6x all NBA, and career 24ppg scorer. #NBATwitter
THIS WHAT @carmeloanthony do!!! Shift them youngins!!! Gotta play smart!!! 
Keep balling my guy @carmeloanthony make the league remember who you are #StayMe70 #HeNeverLeft @NBA
@stevenakohn Wow, can you believe we were there and it was 9 years ago! @carmeloanthony = forever a Knick 
There’s a reason @CP3 @DwyaneWade @KingJames @carmeloanthony @chrisbosh remain a force to this day in the @NBA Kind &amp; quality they possess is unrivaled on and off the court. Athleticism may go but still always invoke the mental bit of this game on anyone any day when called upon.
This is the dumb shit that happens when we dont teach our children that white ppl are racist. They end up going to these universities expecting "love" & tolerance. Instead of being prepared for the behavior & actions of white ppl. In 4 mo there will be another protest somewhere
@carmeloanthony why you do the young man like this. You’re not right lol. 
@carmeloanthony IM SO EXCITED – at Carmelo Anthony Court
Quit it @carmeloanthony 
Get'em @carmeloanthony 
Get'em @carmeloanthony

Can we please bring back @carmeloanthony to the Garden @nyknicks ?
i was one of the best 19 year olds ever.. that zion sht however... idk
Denver. Knicks didn't have to make the trade at all, Carmelo was coming as a free agent anyway
 
@carmeloanthony you stole my move somebody leaked my tape 
This perfectly sums up @carmeloanthony career... losing in the game. Still lost the game. But hey. Melo made a really nice move. 
just take a second to respect a legend, thats all. @carmeloanthony

Still get goosebumps. From the video to the crowd to the always amazing PA announcer. Give us one more run @carmeloanthony #Knicks
Yeaaaaaaahhhh @carmeloanthony 
I really think @gucci1017 "First Song Back" song made me dream of @carmeloanthony and a mean mug flag of Honduras slideshow! I also think Fredo Santana "My Plug" song made me dream of Carmelo Anthony playing for the Utah Jazz! He said somethin about Pistol Pete in that song!
This was a great night for the Knicks! @carmeloanthony
@carmeloanthony still schooling rookies
The only superstar in the history of the NBA to ever have the guts to play basketball on the worlds toughest stage. Thank you @carmeloanthony 
Quel est ton prono pour les 6 matchs a venir sans Lillard ?
Fuck this shit gives me goosebumps STILL. Thank you @carmeloanthony #StayMe7o #NewYorkForever
@carmeloanthony I know it's a Tight situation for the league now &amp; Shit but Kiy look like he know who Trust you supposed feel comfortable specifically if you on Private JET. 
Yea but you see how @carmeloanthony was gettin buckets tho!
Geeeezzz melo, take easy whit the rookie @carmeloanthony 
@carmeloanthony
Swear Tatum reminds me of a young @carmeloanthony! But besides looking like young Melo, I think he gonna be the next KD when KD gone. And if no one thinks he’s either. Then I’ll just say this; he will be a top 3 player when our favorite players are retired. (Tatum/Doncic/Young) 
Denver won the trade. They had a better won-loss record -- by a mile -- from the time of the trade through Melo's last day with the Knicks and got a top starter using a pick they got in the deal. Melo and STAT were incompatible.
#VetMoves @carmeloanthony
