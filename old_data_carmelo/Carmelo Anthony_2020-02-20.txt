Loved your stints with Seattle, Milwaukee and Denver. I’m a life long #Knicks fan. How would you get the best out Mitch, RJ and Knox? Are they a potential small b, Big 3?

@carmeloanthony James King was a student on the way to work when he fell victim to #PoliceBrutality. Beaten unconscious, then charged with felonies for using self-defense. He wants those police held accountable. Will you help us spread attention to #JusticeForJamesKing?
And he’s done it without the three ball, mostly playing isolation offense!
