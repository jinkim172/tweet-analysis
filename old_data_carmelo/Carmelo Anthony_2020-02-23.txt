This looks like it was out in public somewhere, one day bro 
Why couldn’t I get this access. I went on a mission to have him sign my Oak Hill Jersey

He signed StayME7O huh?
Man of the people @carmeloanthony #STAYME7O @sexy_sauseda
@carmeloanthony 
I'll never forget being at that game what it felt like.. We need that back at the Garden
Oh I feel you bro but lol I’m hating melo me & yo favorite player.. I gotta catch the next time he play 
Yeah going to kick it with my son for the weekend.

Yes. Yes I did just watch 30 seconds of ads to watch a 30 second video of @carmeloanthony shooting one shot 
Blazers vs Hawks game next weekend... Finally get to see my favorite player @carmeloanthony play in person..
@carmeloanthony just part of the journey. When the dust settles you will be remembered as one of the greatest to lace em up #StayMe7o
COAST TO COAST @carmeloanthony 
@carmeloanthony put him in the blender. That jab step to pump fake been breaking hearts since Towson Catholic
@Dame_Lillard @CJMcCollum @carmeloanthony @trailblazers GET @TheRealJRSmith on our roster ASAP. He will be a great addition in many aspects. He can do it all offensively and he’s a very underrated defender. GET J.R SMITH signed you guys will not regret doing so I’m telling you.
And the Knicks havent stopped winning since. Sorry I meant Denver.
Who won the game ? Who bullied @carmeloanthony the whole game ? @Zionwilliamson that’s who.
Why can’t people celebrate @Amareisreal too
I can't believe this was 9 years ago. Good times.
@nyknicks retire his number you cowards!!
PG: Dame Dolla @Dame_Lillard SG: Black Mamba @kobebryant PF: Stat @Amareisreal SF: Me7o @carmeloanthony C: Diesel @SHAQ 6th Man: @KlayThompson
Man this was a moment for sure... I would love for the Knicks to bring him back for one season next season @carmeloanthony #KnicksTape #Tape7

@carmeloanthony
#wehereportland @trailblazers #gameday @carmeloanthony @brookeolzendam 
U gave up on yourself...and u will be judged accordingly...w/ ya weak mind 
Facts black people will never progress that’s why I gave up on them 
Or replace Melo with @DevinBook. Certified bucket-getters
Nah Bro I need you, @carmeloanthony , @JCrossover , @thejoejohnson7, @jaytatum0 , and @yg_trece To play King Of the Court Then 3v3
Who they playing
Well it’s official I’m going to Portland in a couple weeks hopefully to watch @Dame_Lillard @CJMcCollum @carmeloanthony @AnferneeSimons Would be first regular season NBA game.
And then nine years ago today, we watched @carmeloanthony’s highlights from the night before approximately 304 times. You can hear the crowd. You can feel the energy. You can sense the excitement. #STAYME7O
Uncle @carmeloanthony giving out free clinics
A lot of trainers have been posting this @carmeloanthony clip but never actually breaking it down. Take a test jab to see if the defender will react. Shot fake to get the defender to jump out of position. Fake the drive to get the defenders hands down and off balance. 
Melo still @carmeloanthony #ESPN #NBA
DENVER
@carmeloanthony!!!! Did you have to welcome @Zionwilliamson to the league like that!?!?! 
Jajajajajajajja huuuuugooooooo @Ender_Jr17
@kobebryant @TheRealJRSmith @carmeloanthony @KingJames @ChrisJHoops @Dame_Lillard @KDTrey5 @kevinlove @TheTraeYoung @DevinBook @B_Ingram13 @Giannis_An34 @Kostas_ante13 @Thanasis_ante43 Stay Blessed KINGS 
My gosh!! 
 bruh really?y gotta do this bro
@carmeloanthony
25-32.. currently NOT a playoff team
@21Blackking - who was the first player in the league to buss yo ass @Zionwilliamson - I’ll be honest with you. It was @carmeloanthony. It’s like I thought I could guard him, but then my thoughts got confused and next thing I know he made a jumper shot and I just had to run back 
@Lakers sign dat man @carmeloanthony... he got sumn to prove 
@carmeloanthony out there #jabsteppingtherook
They graduate 93% but thanks for playing.
 come home @carmeloanthony 
Stick to politics
I love Syracuse...a university that graduates 10% of their “student” athletes. Wonder what the percentage is for the men’s BB program?
Fuckin beautiful yo. @carmeloanthony 
Very under rated player. Should be a first round pic in the NBA draft
Man reason why @KingJames &amp; @kawhileonard is the best “of now” over him, tho @KDTrey5 is the most gifted scorer since @carmeloanthony ....you know, the type you just give em the and it’s a bucket.
Elijah Hughes vs. Georgia Tech: 20 Pts 7 Reb 7 Ast Eli's third 20-5-5 game this season, most in a season since @carmeloanthony had 4 in 2002-03. 
@carmeloanthony I’m forever grateful for this bro. New York was really in a different place back then. You brought joy to this city.
