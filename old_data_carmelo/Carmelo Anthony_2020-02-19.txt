Facts
Why don't you read the stories where we do that? For the record, I never called for the end of his career. That's not my style. You seem to have a lot of anger, I'm sorry about that. I think the league is better with Anthony in it and I'm glad he found a fit that works.
Man how about just when I was going to get my tickets to see my favorite player @carmeloanthony in atl 2/29 and try to get my jersey sign tickets go up $60 in like 24 hrs mannnn melo help a fan out
@carmeloanthony yo foreal tho? Sons of anarchy? 
Why don’t you make giving props to @carmeloanthony the same way you was calling for the end of his career a few months ago
Your awesome dude!
@carmeloanthony Melo I love you to death bro! Great ball player &amp; human being. But your voice is also needed at Syracuse right now. Check that situation bruh. One love!
Word. He shitted on Melo after the Knicks trade now it’s all love.
C’est juste qu’il utilise l’outil de basketball référence je pense haha
@carmeloanthony Class of 2003 Honor Roll for life. Love having you in #RipCity (and my new hoodie by @Blazer_Gang!)

You look like the bat from Ferngully
In the glory days, who played a different style than what he was playing?
I always find morons like you on the internet. If Carmelo walked in the summer you’ve been left with nothing. Your current team in 2020 wouldn’t be how it is now right now if it wasn’t for that trade.
LMAO YEAH RIGHT TRY AGAIN
Okay it’s @carmeloanthony
Hey Lebron you’re right on this. In your NBA experience has any player that you’re aware of use performance enhancement drugs to gain an athletic advantage in basketball? Cc: @DwyaneWade @carmeloanthony @CP3
Replied to everybody but you

Wow is good to hear from you
Oh really... After the things he said about @carmeloanthony &amp; @KenyonMartinSr in his book!!! Please @CoachKarl22 smh.
Thanks very much!
This dude bashed Melo with the Knicks
What a clown
You permanently burned that bridge, Georgie
Stop the lies
To bad you shitted in him when you still had the media's ear
This dude is a .. You dragged @carmeloanthony @KenyonMartinSr and others name in the mud to sell your book. Go fuck yourself!!
@carmeloanthony What ever happened to East &amp; West in the All-Star team Giannis &amp; Team Labron.i dont understand. 
Okay good, just never saw that. And he said some pretty horrible things about not only his play, but his upbringing
.@VernonDavis85, @CarmeloAnthony, @CP3 to launch Players TV network
Bruh you one of the main reasons why he gets so much criticism now
@carmeloanthony What that Tomboy doing tell her to suck it up Kobe grown man private funeral. Alani she got a nose job. Tell LA roll that blunt up Dutch.
People don't understand that if the West wasn't such a bloodbath in those times, Melo would have made the Finals at least once with the Nuggets. '09 is still the closest he's ever got.
Lmaooooo savage
He really thought amar’e was healthy lol
Backhanded compliment. It’s a great great great day when Karl left basketball
Foh your one of the reasons he got blackballed for a lil bit.
Melo accepted his apology in private
I go to court facing eviction summons this thep third such time, we, it’s. Blessing. Lot of emotions I hope I the defendant win my case, I’m ready to win. I’m not dressed up I don’t have 3/3 fashion appearance judge budgeted 2/3 fine lil unnerved go out here in protect my tenancy
The battles vs @kobebryant in the prime years were unforgettable . As a lakers fan I’ve always had deep respect for you and your coaching ability . Hope you’re doing well .
Yeah yeah you know he was a coach killer.
Don’t switch up now bitch, we all know what you said
I stand in Solidarity with the @SyracuseU students peacefully protesting hate crimes (25 of them on campus). "Cuse has suspended them;No water food, medical necessities. As a parent do not expect me to donate again.#NotAgainSU @NYGovCuomo @carmeloanthony @Oprah @megynkelly
Apology not accepted.
Yeah but no defense, bad attitude
What would you have done differently coaching #Melo. I have this theory that most organizations want to make Melo something he was not and never took advantage of what he was.
You snaked him tho 
Heres the issue people can't seem to separate.. Melo may have been tough to play with based off his style of play but Melo will be considered a top 5 offensive player all time. And yes, prime years Melo was a better offensive player than Lebron and anyone else in league

Translation: “my bad”
Too bad he forced his way out of Denver. The Nuggets had a good thing going.
You are the absolute SCUM of this Earth... You don't deserve the right to say the name @carmeloanthony, you fucking snake! You tried to drag this man through the mud to sale that stale ass book! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED BITCH! 
Shoutout to him being a ? Dude was in bed with the enemy 
yeah its pretty hard to avg 25 a game when you "have all that money and no father to show you how to act 'like a man'" say cheese 
@DwyaneWade RIP KOBE this is a legendary pic right here @carmeloanthony @CP3 
I just found out @carmeloanthony is Puerto Rican 
So being @carmeloanthony is back n the NBA... can we get @JCrossover to the @Lakers ???? He shoots, CREATES, Nd PLAYS defense!!! #LakeShow

7年前のオールスターか。 コービーとメロがガチで1on1でガンガンやりあってて、時計が止まった瞬間、デュラントが「俺も混ぜろ〜」って感じで駆け寄ってきたのが印象に残ってる。 @kobebryant @carmeloanthony 
Y’all got to stop disrespecting @carmeloanthony like this 
I became a Nuggets fan during the Melo years. Those were some really fun teams, 2009 is one of my all time favorite seasons
This culture has lost its mind! It’s his friends like @kingjames @cp3 and @carmeloanthony that remains silent because they afraid what #LGBTQ is going to do to them! They trying to make this a trend... then make… https://www.instagram.com/p/B8u_SnqBzTD/?igshid=1lfdt63bumdp8
You both had some of your best years together!
Thanks @zorrro1955!
Regular season is over @madehoops Time to get better for the playoffs #PeytonHowell #classof2027 #classof2026 @carmeloanthony #Blackops @Jumpman23 #jordan34 #StayMe7O #JordanBrand #NYC @jalenlecque10 @CP3NMSC @CP3 @CCoastpreps @overtime @baldwin_bruins @247sports @NYCHoops @ESPNU
Coach been a fan since I was a kid and used to sneak into ABA games at the auditorium loved watching your teams play
And he never played defense, so we didn't even have to think if it was easy!
Everyone forgets that early on he was known as someone who could fill it up with minimal touches. All that is remembered now is him pounding the rock for NYK. Somehow underrated.
Cuse guys? @EricDungey @carmeloanthony @donovanjmcnabb @mikegbinije can all get the work if they want it. Me and @mikegbinije are from the same city
@carmeloanthony how are you doing 
Agree!
Yea lol
Bro... spellcheck hit you hard on Collin Sexton 
Should I cop this @carmeloanthony nuggets jersey 
Two errant passes against the Lakers aside the Nuggets should’ve been NBA CHAMPS! My family love you coach! #Karlstrong
He made nuggets relevant again!!! He deserves his number to be hoisted high above Pepsi center..
That nigga @carmeloanthony was in the gym all all star week
Should’ve tried to persuaded him more. Denver would’ve had a ring by now.
These two were absolute 110% savages on the court. True savages. True brain surgeons too the way they’d get in their opponent’s heads. Melo once waited outside KG’s locker room bc KG had him so pissed. Shout out to @KevinGarnett5KG and Kob’! And @carmeloanthony
That baseline jumper made to look easy
@carmeloanthony Innocent man beaten by police. Charged HIM with felonies to avoid accountability. No #JusticeForJamesKing. Nonprofit law firm fighting back. U.S. Supreme Court appeal. Please draw attention to this issue by sharing this video: https://youtu.be/HujPlUyTXRY!
