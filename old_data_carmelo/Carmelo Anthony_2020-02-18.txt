Lol so have you apogolized for some of the horrible things you said about him?!?!?
Those were great years!
@carmeloanthony EU TE AMO, ME NOTA
My least favorite part too!
Hardest part of that trade was losing Chauncey. Still bitter Joker made forget about the drama
You should do like all those you tag and mind your own business. Wade kid is his kid and he decides how he raise his kids.....see that why blk folks cant progress always mind other folks business.
Loved what @1MrBigShot did for our culture here in Denver!

Saw your first game as nuggets head coach it was epic!
Thanks @Bucketsince88!
Hey coach I really enjoyed your book! I wish the players of today were mentally tougher like they were in your era. Gary Payton would take a lot of these scoring point guards right out of the game.
We witnessed greatness
Miss ya Coach Karl, hope you’re doing well
Thanks @MoTThatsMe!
Been reflecting on @carmeloanthony lately - the best scorer I ever coached. He’s always made scoring look so easy. And it’s not!

@carmeloanthony I’ve been a fan since day one. I have a work trip to Portland next week. Any chance you could sign my Trail Blazers Melo Jersey? It would be a dream come true. Keep up the good work you’re the man! #00

1) 6'0, running the fast break/passing 2) @Lakers 3) regular season MVP, tourney MVP, 2x all star selection 4) @KingJames &amp; @carmeloanthony 5) hydrate (probably too much) 6) feat. Justin Darlington, one of the world's best dunkers 
Enjoy listening, keep up the good content!
Yo, it's DOPE to see our content randomly pop up on my TL! I asked this question cause in my head, I was hoping he'd say with @carmeloanthony they woulda won multiple rings! I think Detroit woulda shaped Melo game in diff ways!!! 
@carmeloanthony that donor money might clarify this situation. 
@carmeloanthony
Próximo vai ser @YuriFonseca28 e o @carmeloanthony
I really think if @drose never got injured @carmeloanthony is going to Chicago. A prime Melo even for 2 years in a Thibbs system where discipline is a must I think gets the Bulls over the hump. No one would bring fucking with the Bulls.
