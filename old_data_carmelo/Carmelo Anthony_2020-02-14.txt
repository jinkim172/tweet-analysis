@SteveTsak did it first @carmeloanthony 
Got to do a portrait of @carmeloanthony a few days ago. #carmeloSilva #CarmelosInkCity #bnginksociety #basketball #syracuse #15 #guyswithink #guyswithtattoos #inkstagram #inkstagood #legsleeve #tattooofinstagram… https://www.instagram.com/p/B8kOJhnl-Ou/?igshid=4gzio9ve51t6
@carmeloanthony can i get a turn up ?
Come back to NY
Ever just miss @carmeloanthony on a Friday
After watching @KDTrey5 on All The Smoke I've come to the conclusion once @carmeloanthony retires from the association. I'm fuckin with KD. Before he got injured he was the best player in the L. More importantly listen to him speak his truths, bro is a REAL 1. #Respect
Yo, @carmeloanthony could you hit up the NBA store have them put some more of your jerseys in stock? Your boy trying to represent but they out of XL

@carmeloanthony
i cant deny his impact but when you have 4 guys that avg 17-19 a game, i dont think you pick 1 guy from that team and leave 27/6 dbook out of the ASG. i think calling okc overachievers is enough recognition i dont like the playoff team= automatic 1 all star narrative
It got him the “exile” that is OKC and he was meant to shopped. Instead CP3 has helped make the Thunder one of the funnest squads and a legit playoff team in the loaded west. Someone their deserved the credit IMO.
And they put on a show...
10 all time current era @NBA players to get to know me 1. @KingJames 2. @DwyaneWade 3. @KarlTowns 4. @kobebryant 5. @ZachLaVine 6. @carmeloanthony 7. @DwightHoward 8. @Zionwilliamson 9. @AntDavis23 10. @JimmyButler #NBAAllStar
Been saying that since '04 Melo definitely got robbed for ROY
I actually counter troll. You and your butt buddy have been trying to spam troll me for days. I guess you thought I would give up easier. When that didn't work you blocked me...again. Have fun on your public access radio show mr. business man. 

Troll
So you added those random GIF's that did not pertain to the conversation in the name of business? I'm no business man, but that seems counter productive to attracting sponsors. I am a sports fan who calls people out on their ignorant bullshit. You fit that category to a T.
"Being able to tell our own stories is very very powerful... Now is when we'll start to understand how much power we have, how strong of a voice we have" - @carmeloanthony on the significance of Players TV
#trailblazers forward @carmeloanthony talks about his next business venture, players tv, athletes on demand. #NBAAllStar #NBAAllStarWeekend #NBA #NBAAllStar2020 – at 333 N. Michigan Ave. Building
.@carmeloanthony says sports are all about routine, "it's monotonous," but now "when you leave the gym, leave the gym... once I'm out of the gym at 2 p.m., my other day starts." That allows him to focus both on his business and on basketball and avoid boredom, which hurts both
Katelyn Ohashi just said she was training 36 hours a week by the time she was 12 and this panel full of NBA and NFL players all just quietly lost it.
CJ asked the panel a question about how athletes are expected/pressured to "stay in their box," @Vernondavis emphasizes the importance of finding balance and working with people who can help you find that balance
.@katelyn_ohashi is now talking energetically about the issue of pay and opportunity for college athletes; they've come a long way but more change is needed
He is also wearing a very nice sweater
.@carmeloanthony started his production company because he wanted to work with people whose stories needed to be told; 7-10 projects in the works currently

Why do you hate it?? Because you’re a hater... 
Those Bronny shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever played in.
Man, I'm glad to have both of these kicks IRL!
Cmon now bro baby steps he ain’t even play all the games first half of the season
No help!!! @stephenasmith Expect a call from @carmeloanthony and @CJMcCollum
So much fabric
and its only gonna get worse cuz if luka couldnt get in with averages of 21/8/6 then why would future great rookies with lower #'s get in? i think ja should be in over chris paul cuz 17/7>17/6, i think cp3's position in the nba players association got him in
We bash LeBron n Kd for ring chasing , then bash melo and cp3 for winning no rings @carmeloanthony @CP3
@carmeloanthony #STAYME7O
This set the precedent that stopped bonafide studs like Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell and Luka Doncic from getting All-Star berths in their rookie campaign
These XIX just made me realise that @carmeloanthony was born the same time the @Jumpman23 was 
Why not @carmeloanthony 
I’m a businessman who talks sports.
melo got robbed of rookie of the year. a lot of people want ja in the all star game cuz hes having a solid season and mem is 8 seed but i think ROTY is enough recognition. melo as a rookie was better than bron(& ja) and he couldnt even get ROTY, let alone an all star appearance
So we are the ones sending random spam GIF's or was that someone else? I have been talking football entirely which was the subject of our original conversation. If you can't handle being proved wrong that is your prerogative.
3XL 
U and mike are trolls I don’t have time for nonsense.
@carmeloanthony 
@carmeloanthony 
Playoffs trash without the @trailblazers . @Dame_Lillard @CJMcCollum tell whiteside keep playing Defense. @carmeloanthony @TrevorAriza @AnferneeSimons tell Trent Jr. KNOCK.DOWN. !

Why you gonna block me again? 

Kiss my ass
I was a senior in hs.. I remember telling my fam n friends enjoy this. In my lifetime I knew we hadnt had a guy like that. Get the ball in the post an just takeover. Put up a shot. Miss. get his own rebound and finish. It was a thing of beauty. Perfect storm season
@carmeloanthony 
Hey carmelo you are well respected by me I seen everything that has happened in our poor country even tho we're not from there we have family there parents who are puertorican I wanna thank u for the things u have done for puertorico your a hero to all those people and me
@carmeloanthony 
@carmeloanthony
31-20 says they were the ones getting punched in the face. They just couldn’t keep it up for 4 quarters and fell flat when it mattered most. FYI either block me or don’t. Stop this childish block/unblock crap though.

@carmeloanthony can you sign my jersey please
Imagine spending your days on Twitter blocking and unblocking people because they called you out for the idiocy you post. **smh**
Sure thing buddy. Whatever you want to try to convince yourself.
@carmeloanthony
I was in eighth grade, and as a wiser, smarter guy now I really wish I could relive that season. The three court storming game vs Pitt, the both games vs nd, the game at Michigan State in the middle of the conference season, ot away win & bet game vs gtown, and the whole ncaa run
I never fully appreciated how good Melo really was at Cuse when I was watching him. He really was, if not the best, in the top 5 Cuse players of all time after only one year there.
The for cuse basketball
Ready argument IMHO. Just look at @rodneyhood, @youngwhiteside and @carmeloanthony. I think played are also wiser... They want to play with others they respect and will help them be better players. Money is less of an issue because even taking less money is still a lot of money. 
@carmeloanthony has been my favorite since his college days.
Both are better than Mahomes
@carmeloanthony would win that no problem. Id guarantee my next two paychecks
