You gotta step up rest of the season you need to be number 2 option next to Lavine play angry ., 
Stop it! When they do pass it to him he passes it off a lot! Kill the excuses 
He didnt touch the ball in the second half except for when he bombed that 3 or got a rebound basically
Goat
Give volleyball a try
Maybe if they would pass to him
21
Just avg 15+, 1 block and 8+ boards for the rest of the season and will get the W in my fantasy league 
next Season will be better. you are a very good player and so important for my bulls. 
You'll get em next time man 
proud of u no matter what buddy
Show'em that Savage Life..... Give'em some of that Finnish Wolfpack
He played 18 minutes. Come on.
Gar himself saw @DomesticGsm in his Jersey and loved it 
Glad to see you back. Keep playing your game. Forget about coach, just keep being aggressive and getting your looks.
Bro you’re my favorite current Bull player, but you gotta step up. Bring that last season you, you got a lot of potential, lets get it!
#BullsNation Hope you can stay healthy and hopefully when @ZachLaVine gets back, you can make a final push for the playoffs
Ya se le extrañaba en la duela! @MarkkanenLauri 
Glad you are back. Hope you can continue to improve. #Go Bulls #Ignore the Haters.

Just happy you’re back. I don’t think there are too many people concerned with getting W’s for the rest of the season. Just stay healthy and get in your groove.
Both our franchises are a mess but Markkanen isn't going to NY lmao
Da Great W., Hope... 
BUT.....YOUR`s FIRST;_NOT WORRYYYYY:)
I’m pretty sure I seen the same type of video from a bulls fan
13pts and 4 rebounds (from a 7ftr) ain't doing the job 
 Spike will be good just a little drama queen
Worry about getting kicked out of MSG for complaining about Dolan 
Worry about Dolan and Spike Lee 
#FIREGARPAX
Hyvä Lauri!
Worry about Garpax 
U, Carter should be getting 20 passes a game in the paint, screw the contested outside 3 attempts non stop, that's why the Bulls have dismal record, fouls are not committed on contested 3s , fouls are committed in the paint, too bad guards would not C U if U slashed your way in
Keep fighting man. You looked good out there
run a stretch 4 out the city***
So handsome
Welcome back 
Gonna look amazing in a knicks uniform we know how to run a stretch 4
So glad you are healthy and playing again.
Didn’t get the job done but felt good to be out there with my guys! 
Hang in there Lauri, change is coming...
Welcome back bigboy... keep up the good work...you're a great bbq player who is fun to watch...if you will, stop putting up picks and just cut to the rim...your teammates should then find you...

@NesteGlobal @NesteSuomi @MarkkanenLauri @MarinSanna Neste Oil stop using palm oil products!!! Now!!! We need every tree in rainforests. We can not lose any of them! The Earth is choking!
Love that pic! I wish I had a poster of it. Welcome back LAURI. 
My favorite BULL So glad your back! May you be blessed!!!
힘내 bro
Paxson signed him to a 2 year extension last season so he'll be back next season & I don't think I can take another season of this crap 1 of the top 3 biggest markets in the nba and can't make the playoffs man that sucks
This game pissed my off no way we should've lost to a team that's just as bad as us I got a funny feeling Paxson is gonna bring the entire team back next season

Lauri Markkanen makes layup (@MarkkanenLauri) 
Queria dizer pro @MarkkanenLauri que eu o amo e que eu senti muita falta dele em quadra &lt;3
Not sure what's going on but, im so disappointed in @MarkkanenLauri play this season. For some reason all he wants to do is play on the perimeter. A design system, him or both but it's not working at all. Should've been a peaking all-star from what he did last season. #myopinion
