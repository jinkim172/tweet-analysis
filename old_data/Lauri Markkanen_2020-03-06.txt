@RealMikeWilbon just said on @NBATheJump he's out on @MarkkanenLauri smfh so much promise smh, I don't wanna let go of the rope too, at least one more season but strongly believe they should #FireBoylen #FireGarPax #CleanHouse are you hearing us #DougCollins @chicagobulls
What is up with the knicks and power forwards?! 
How are you happy after a loss? That’s the problem!

Kuuntele ittees...
You’re a tiger, not a slave..
Get the hell out of there, mentally hard..., If they suck you dry, it’s hard to smile and tell everyone it’s okay...
Everyone associated with the bulls deserves a better head coach
You obviously didn’t watch the game
Good to see you back out there big guy
If the Warriors can’t make a play for Giannis this summer, I’m going after @ZachLaVine and @MarkkanenLauri period.. just me as a GM 
He's not talented? It's more of a mental edge and me first attitude thing, along with situation in my opinion.
Showcase your low post game
He does need to knock his shots down, you're right. You just acted like he was bad last night and he really wasn't. But overall yeah, get tough.
You ain’t no Chicagoan go shoot some deer brotha
That’s like a kindergarten bitch come back
Felicio makes millions....i bet he's Lebron in your eyes.... 
@MarkkanenLauri would t bag your face while the ball falls throw the hoop onto your face after being dunked on and ur telling the man making millions he’s not getting the job done go buy a Knicks jersey prick
Lmao im slow? Look in the mirror . You clearly don't know wtf your talking about. 
Are you dumb? CAUSE THEIR PG/SG. Their supposed to bring up the ball and make/set up the plays. Lauri is a pf. Whenever they pass the ball he actually does something... Do you even watch our games?
All these dumb excuses for Lauri but Zach and Coby doesn't need a babysitter....i wonder why? #Talent

Exactly! They just cannot get round to find a way to use Lauri the best way. I believe biggest obstacle is the idea how american team should revolve around the star and team player might be too far out to fit in, no matter how versatile one would be
