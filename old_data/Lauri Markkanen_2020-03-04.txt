I picked you up for my fantasy team. Feel free to drop a fifty point triple double.
The bulls can turn their season around today. Let’s take the momentum from Monday and go on a run. We’re back at near full strength with @MarkkanenLauri back. Our you bull @CobyWhite is balling. Let’s go out and attain that grain. #BullsNation @chicagobulls
Take us to the playoffs
Welcome back Lauri LEGEND @MarkkanenLauri #BullsNation
Welcome back bro ! Missed you 
Goodluck Lauri!
Better Offense will create more efficiency and better shots but individual players need to make plays. Dunn can’t shoot, not good enough playmaker, Lauri is “eh” defender, no abilities to break down a defense,create his own... Zach is in the same offense and you see his skills
I want to see @MarkkanenLauri do more of this 2night in CHI/MIN. Go inside &amp; grab those rebounds. The #BullsNation needs to do a much better job getting those rebounds &amp; 50/50 balls moving forward. 
Elevate your game
It’s the Bulls offense. If we had a motion offense Lauri, Zach, and Dunn would benefit.
Let's go @MarkkanenLauri! Glad to see you're back.
Welcome back 
 #BullsNation
Welcome back, @MarkkanenLauri! 
Welcome back!!
These highlights are his problem. Rarely creates his own shot, doesn’t have post/dribbles moves to win matchups. Last play was only one where he made a dribble move -didn’t get by the man, just shot over. Not worth close to max. Trade him for value on contract and better team fit
Welcome back Lauri #BullsNation
LETS GO!!!! BALL OUT FELLA! #BullsNation

Legggo Lauri
Good, now stop playing soft
Welcome back. Now start back driving to the paint where you were SO effective !!!
I didn’t know he was gone.
I’m going to my #FirstBullsGame tonight and am so pumped that he’s playing! Let’s get that Win tonight fellas!
In honor of @MarkkanenLauri’s return tonight against the @Timberwolves...
A veure com torna. Diuen que a principis de temporada jugava amb lesions. Amb sort haurà fet net.
As photogenic as ever.
Time to put an end to all the doubts @MarkkanenLauri, ignore Jim, play your game. Otto definitely wasn’t listening to that no mid-range BS in his return. 
welcome back

Yes
Minute limit on lauri?
@__playboity
Näytä niille Late! 
Let's goooooooo @MarkkanenLauri #BullsNation he's putting up 20pts+ tonight. 
Let's goooooo is back @MarkkanenLauri 
Healthy Lauri, hoping for some solid production out of him the rest of the season to get his confidence back. Regardless we need a fresh start with a new coach for the young talent we have being wasted right now.
Bust
If only Thibedeau could have fired them instead of the other way around
Hope he comes back strong.
Welp
KAT is a happy man after this tweet...He will score over 50 tonight.

What about Lavine?

Really good news!
Greatest shooter in history!
It’s official. @MarkkanenLauri is back tonight and will start against the Timberwolves. We’re so excited to have this dude back out there. #BullsNation #BullsUK #Bulls #TheFinnisher
Ma maaaaaaan! 
Go @MarkkanenLauri 
Wow 3 games in a row and 3 new players
@nba_en_catala 
Love it! But starting to get of the train on Lauri, idk if it’s coaching (most likely is) not using his full potential and utilizing his abilities or Lauri himself. Prob a mix of both. Lauri season debut vs Hornets was we all expect him to do. He should be a 20ppg+ 10reb+ numbers
Would adore for him to be good this time around.
No reason a starting lineup of Coby, Lavine, Porter, Lauri and Carter shouldn’t be doing nothing. We gotta get rid of the office

AMD Boylen will put him back in a spot up shooter role

Good to see Lauri Back in the action! Good luck Bulls for tonights game!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS:)
My hero
This should be our month, shit we already have the same amount of wins as last month
Yes finally
