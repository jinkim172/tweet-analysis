Maybe a little dress for success is in order for this bunch. Not a good look.
Lauri reminds me so much of the Russian boxer in Rocky IV. I can't stop playing the video of the Survivor band playing "Burning Heart" for that movie. Maybe the Bulls need to adopt that as their theme song for inspiration.
Otto Porter has that I just stole a full year of money and gonna do it again next year face on.
I can’t believe this article exists. #FirePax
So is coby starting orrrrrrrr?

Yep. Last night he definitely did.
Daniel the dude stinks. Mentally weak. Always an excuse with him.

Please go be a fan somewhere else. You were just here for Lauri, you can say otherwise but we know the truth. @MarkkanenLauri is a weak Finland POS.
There are still @MarkkanenLauri fans in Chicago? Lmao. Guy is so mentally weak. Atleast Andrea Bargnani strung together a few good seasons. #Bullsnation
